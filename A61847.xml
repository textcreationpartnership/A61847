            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALbeit I am no friend to Epiſtles Dedicatory, becauſe they too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently prove, to uſe the Cynick's Phraſe, but <hi>mellifluous ſnares;</hi> yet becauſe common Juſtice obligeth me <hi>to return unto every man his own,</hi> I find my ſelf under an eſſential Obligation to prefix Your Ladyſhips Name to the enſuing Noble Diſcourſe: and that not merely by reaſon of the Truſt you were pleaſed to commit unto me for the Publication thereof, but rather, becauſe Divine Providence has made Your Ladyſhip the Midwife to conduct this Noble Birth into Light, which otherwiſe muſt neceſſarily have layen buried in the womb of Darkneſs. And, Madam, give me leave to ſpeak it, Your Honour is herein the greater, in that you undertook this ſervice ſo laborious and difficult, which no other mortal, as I am aſſured, was in a capacity to perform; You being the only Perſon, who very opportunely were inſtructed in that Character wherein the Original Copy was writ. Madam, I am not of thoſe who admire Titles of Honour, further than they are ſhadows of Virtue; but rather am of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the moroſe Philoſopher, <hi>that Honours without Virtues are but the Maſques of Vices;</hi> yet Your Ladyſhip will be aſſured, that the Honour You have acquired by this generous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakement, is far more illuſtrious than that which Nature has conferred on You. <hi>Solomon</hi> gives us an excellent Character of an Honourable Lady, <hi>Prov. 11.16.</hi>

And what greater Honour can be acquired and retained, than that which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the ſervice of Chriſt and his Churches? What more Honourable than for a creature to be immediately employed in the ſervice of his Creator? Doth it not ſpeak a Mind deſcended from on High, and truely generous, to be inſpired with a divine Ambition of being engaged in ſervice for the King of Kings? Is man ever greater, than when greatly ſerviceable to his Lord? Was it not a great effate of the Moraliſt, <hi>That he who will be truly Free and Noble, muſt ſerve Philoſophy?</hi> What Liberty then and Nobility do they acquire, who ſerve Theology!

The common Title
<pb facs="tcp:52030:3"/> of Honour given to Courtiers among the <hi>Perſians,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Jews,</hi> was, <hi>Men of Preſence:</hi> And who are the <hi>Men of Gods preſence,</hi> but ſuch as are engaged in the ſervice of his Church?

And O! what a luſtre of Divine Honour remains on them to this very day? Again, there is an Honourable mention made of other virtuous Women, who employed their time and labours in the ſervice of the Church, <hi>Exod. 35.25, 26.

He was indeed a Perſon intimely and familiarly acquainted with the deepeſt points in Theology; but yet as to theſe that relate to the Covenant of Grace, his Spirit ſeems to have been moſt deeply baptized and immerſed into them; which any judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader may with facility perceive by a tranſient inſpection into any part of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Of what incomparable excellent Uſe this Diſcourſe may be for the diffuſing Evangelic Light and Truth no one can be ignorant,<note place="margin">The excellent uſe of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</note> who is acquainted with the mind and intendment either of the Law or Goſpel; or ſenſible of thoſe many dangerous errours, which have of late ſprung up from the ignorance of both: How many have taken away the uſe of the Law, thereby to advance, as they conceit, the Grace of the Goſpel? And have not too many on the other hand deſtroyed the Grace of the Goſpel, whiles they have endeavoured to exalt the letter of the Law as a Covenant? Both theſe extremes our judicious Author has accurately obviated and avoided: He has approved himſelf a good Advocate for the Law, as it is a rule and inſtrument ſubſervient to the Goſpel; but yet he gives the Goſpel the principal place and preeminence as it is ſaiths <hi>magna Charta:</hi> He has indeed exactly hit the difference between the two Covenants, which argues his deep inſight into both: and ſurely they that rightly underſtand the Idea or Notion of the two Covenants, attain thereby a clue of thread to lead them into the moſt intricate Myſteries of Evangelic Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines: as on the contrary thoſe who have not right ſentiments of the two Covenants, what heſitation and ſuſpenſion, if not errour and miſapprehenſion do they fall under in the moſt momentous points of Religion! Yea, doth not the rectitude not only of our Faith, but alſo of our Chriſtian practice and converſation principally depend on the due notices of the two Covenants? Are not theſe as the centre, wherein all the lines of Divine Grace and humane Duty meet? Are we not then greatly obliged to this our Author for his ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate endeavours in this work? He demonſtrates, (1) <hi>That God never did nor will deal with mankind meerly in a way of Dominion, but alſo in a way of Covenant.</hi> (2) <hi>That both Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants are made with men not immediately, but in and by ſome publick perſon.</hi> (3) <hi>That it is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with either of theſe publick perſons that brings a man under their Covenant.</hi> (4) <hi>That it is impoſſible for any man to be under both Covenants;</hi> becauſe the terms and conditions of the

               <note place="margin">The Covenant of works and its curſe.</note>Our Author begins his Diſcourſe with the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> and treats firſt of the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Curſe</hi> that attends the breach thereof; and then of the <hi>Spiritual;</hi> of which more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Contents: we ſhall only give ſome ſhort and particular Reflections on and Notions of this firſt Covenant. (1) <hi>The Covenant made with</hi> Adam <hi>was not particular with his perſon under a ſingle capacity, but with his nature as a common perſon or repreſentative Head, from whom all mankind were by natural generation to deſcend:</hi> and herein the Covenant made with <hi>Adam</hi> differs from that made with the Angels, which was particular and perſonal, they being all created at once, and exiſtent when their Covenant was made. Hence, (2) <hi>In this firſt Covenant made with</hi> Adam <hi>all his poſterity ſtand bound to God both naturally, by virtue of their being created in him, and voluntarily, by virtue of his ſtipulation.</hi> Whence, (3) <hi>Every ſon of</hi> Adam <hi>falls under both the duties and curſes of his Covenant:</hi> for as the duties, ſo the curſes of <hi>Adams</hi> Covenant ſeized, not meerly on <hi>Adams</hi> ſingle perſon, but on his nature, and ſo on all mankind, who are in him both legally and naturally. Thence, (4) <hi>No man can be freed from the curſe of the Law, that is not freed from it as a Covenant.</hi> There is ſince <hi>Adams</hi> Fall an eſſential and inſeparable connexion between the Curſe and Covenant: the Curſe naturally attends the Covenant; every ſon of <hi>Adam</hi> neceſſarily falls under the former as well as the latter.<note place="margin">Mens natural deſire to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</note> (5) <hi>All men naturally and ardently deſire to be under</hi> Adams <hi>Covenant.</hi> The natural blindneſs and pride of mens hearts ſtrongly impels them to build a Spiders houſe of their own, on which they may lean, as <hi>Job</hi> 8.14, 15. Are not all men by nature <hi>children of the bond-woman,</hi> and ſo poſſeſt with a <hi>ſpirit of bondage?</hi> Have they not a legal ſpirit anſwerable to the Covenant they are under? And doth not this legal ſpirit bring forth ſuitable fruits? Do not ſuch as are informed and acted by it perform all ſervices to God in the <hi>oldneſs of the letter,</hi> in a formal, ſervile, legal manner, without regard to Chriſt the Mediator? Yea is not this legal ſpirit, whereby thoſe under <hi>Adams</hi> Covenant are acted, full of enmity and oppoſition againſt Chriſt, his Righteouſneſs, and all the terms of his new Covenant? Doth not ſuch mens rejecting the terms and grace of the ſecond Covenant argue their ſtrong propenſions, yea vehement impulſes towards <hi>Adams</hi> Covenant? Are not all their ſpiritual Gifts, common Graces, legal Righteouſneſſes, as well as all their ſins imployed to oppoſe the Grace and Righteouſneſs of the ſecond Covenant? And if their conſciences be at any time awakened and their ſins ſet in order before them in all their bloody aggravations, yet what a difficult thing is it to bring them off from the old Covenant? What hard, black, ſcandalous thoughts of Chriſt are they filled with? How do their hearts ſink under unbelieving deſpondences, and baſe jealouſies of Chriſt? And doth not all this argue mens vehement deſires to be found under the firſt Covenant? (6) <hi>The more the glory of the ſecond Covenant is revealed to ſuch as are under the firſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The rejection of the ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</note> 
               <hi>the greater efforts, and more vehement oppoſition they put forth againſt it.</hi> The more mens natural reaſon is elevated by ſupernatural common illumination, the more ſtout-hearted they are againſt the terms of the new Covenant: all their moral righteouſneſſes ſerve only to ſet them farther off from the righteouſneſs of faith: their good deeds as well as their bad for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them againſt the embracement of the new Covenant, becauſe it would ſpoil them of their own righteouſneſſes, which they have wrought ſo hard for all their days, and ſubject them to the righteouſneſs of God. Do we not find all this greatly exemplified in the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees and legal Jews, who having eſpouſed to themſelves the old Covenant rejected Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs? (7) <hi>For men thus electively to put themſelves under the firſt Covenant, and reject the grace of the ſecond, is a ſin of the firſt magnitude and deepeſt aggravations.</hi> Hath not the great God exalted the ſecond Covenant above the firſt? Is it not then an high in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury againſt him, to bring down that Covenant God has exalted, and to exalt that which he has made null, above it? Is not Chriſt the Mediator of the new Covenant, the greateſt gift that ever God vouchſafed mankind?<note place="margin">God juſtly leaves ſuch to the Covenant they deſire.</note> Oh! then how injurious is it to God to reject ſo great a gift, and the grace offered by him? (8) <hi>It is therefore juſt with the righteous God to leave men to ſtand or fall by that Covenant under which they ſo ſtrongly deſire to be.</hi> Doth the holy and bleſſed God do the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> any wrong in leaving them under his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, unto which they have ſuch a ſtrong impulſe and deſire? If he hereby gives them but the deſire of their heart, what cauſe have they to complain againſt him? And will not his procedure at laſt day appear to be moſt juſt and rational in judging men according to the tenure of the firſt Covenant unto which they had ſo ſtrong a deſire? May not God juſtly lay to their charge every the leaſt ſin, and make them bear the burden of it, ſeeing they have put themſelves under a Covenant that admits not any Mediator? Whom have they to repreſent their perſons, to bear their ſins, to pay their debts, to endure their curſe, to perform their duties, ſeeing they reject the Mediator of the ſecond Covenant?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:52030:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>This leads to the ſecond general Head,<note place="margin">The miſery of ſuch as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</note> 
               <hi>The deplorable and miſerable ſtate of ſuch as are under the firſt Covenant.</hi> (1) Is it not a deplorable caſe for men voluntarily to elect their own ruine? Was it ever known that men did contentedly, yea chearfully ſit down under a ſtate of moſt miſerable bondage, when full liberty was offered to them by a benign gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Prince? Doth it not argue a ſpirit immerſed in the baſeſt ſervitude to take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence in its chains and fetters? And yet is not this the very caſe of all ſuch as deſire to be under the firſt Covenant? (2) Is it not a miſerable thing for a man to be on the very brink of ruine, and yet not ſenſible of it, yea under a fond preſumption of a bleſſed ſtate? For a man to go as an Ox to the ſlaughter adorned with a garland made up of the fading flowers of his own righteouſneſſes, what folly and madneſs is this! And yet is not this the very caſe of all Phariſaic ſpirits, who live and die under the firſt Covenant? Is not a good conceit of a bad ſtate moſt dangerous and miſerable? To be alive in carnal preſumptions, ſelf-flattery, and ſelf-ſufficiency, and yet ſpiritually dead in Divine eſtimation, is it not the worſt of deaths? Are not ſuch next degree to falling into Hell, who fondly flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they can ſtand longer and ſurer than others by their own forces, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12? And are not ſuch as put themſelves under the firſt Covenant guilty of all theſe pieces of folly? (3) Is it not a ſad caſe for ſinners to put themſelves under a Covenant which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gives or admits a Mediator? To have none to repreſent their perſons, but to be left ſtanding before the righteous holy God in their own names, bearing their own ſins, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to be juſtified by their own works, to pay their own debts, or to endure their own puniſhment, what greater miſery can there be? (4) To be under a Covenant that neither promiſes, nor gives, nor accepts of Repentance; but leaves men to live and die in their ſins, without the leaſt drop of the blood of Chriſt to waſh them away, what a ſad caſe is this? Muſt not ſuch expect, that as ſoon as they peep out of the grave, and lift up their traiterous heads, their own conſciences as alſo Divine Juſtice condemn and purſue them unto all eternity? (5) Is it not alſo a moſt wretched forlorn caſe for men to have their perſons hated, yea loathed by the God of all love and mercy, and thence their beſt ſervices rejected for the leaſt failings in them? And is not this the caſe of all ſuch as ſtand under the firſt Covenant? Doth this Covenant afford the leaſt reward to any ſervices that have the leaſt imperfection adherent to them? And can ſinners offer to God any ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſervices? Will it not thence hence neceſſarily follow, that ſuch as ſtand under this firſt Covenant have all their ſervices rejected, all their ſins imputed to them, their perſons hated, their bleſſings curſed, and all the curſes of the Law bound faſt on their conſciences, by the ſentence of the righteous God? What are all their ſeeming ſervices but real ſins? and what are all Gods rewards to them but real curſes, albeit ſeeming bleſſings? What can they expect for ſuch unſanctified ſervices but unſanctified rewards, which are indeed real curſes?</p>
            <p>But to treat ſomewhat more diſtinctly of the miſery which attends ſuch as are under the firſt Covenant, we may conſider it under theſe two Heads, that both the Law and Goſpel,<note place="margin">The Law to ſuch as are under the firſt Covenant the means of death.</note> which are means of Life and Salvation to ſuch as are under the firſt Covenant, prove as to them means of Death and Condemnation. Firſt as to the Law, it proves the means of death and condemnation to ſuch as are under the firſt Covenant two ways: (1) In regard of its <hi>coactive Rigor.</hi> (2) As it <hi>irritates Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Law doth by its coactive Rigor work death and condemnation in ſuch as are under the firſt Covenant.</hi> Doth not the Law exact of ſuch perfect obedience,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>1.</hi> By its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion.</note> but gives them no ſtrength to perform it? It's true, the Law requires obedience of thoſe who are under the ſecond Covenant alſo; but the promiſe gives what the Law requires: But of ſuch as are under the firſt Covenant perfect obedience is required, but no intern principle is engraffed; duty is required, but no love or delight therein conferred: Yea do not ſuch perform duty as godly men commit ſin? May they not ſay of ſin as <hi>Paul</hi> doth of duty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15. <hi>What I would that I do not?</hi> And what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of Sin, may not ſuch ſay the ſame of Duty, <hi>What I hate that do I?</hi> The Law diſcovers ſin to thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the firſt Covenant; but did it ever caſt out any one ſin diſcovered by it? Sin is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wounded by it; but did it ever kill any one ſin? Are not the hearts of ſuch like <hi>Ezechiels pot,</hi> in which the ſcum did ariſe, but then boyled in again? The Law drags ſuch to the Tribunal of God as a righteous Judge, but can they ever come to God as a Father? Is not this the priviledge of ſuch only as are under the ſecond Covenant? Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Law drives ſuch as are under the firſt Covenant unto ſelf-condemnation, but can any thing but the Goſpel work Juſtification and Peace of Conſcience? So deadly and mortiferous is the Law to ſuch as are under its violent compulſion and coaction as it is a Covenant. And whence is it that the Law hath ſuch a compulſive power over ſuch as are under it as a Covenant? (1) Is it not from thoſe Principles of ſelf-love and legal
<pb facs="tcp:52030:5"/> fear implanted in the heart of man, whereby he is conſtrained to duty and reſtrained from ſin by the threats and terrors of the Law, which move Conſcience as extern weights move artificial <hi>Automata,</hi> or machines? O! what a great power has Conſcience over ſuch when acted and enflamed by the terrors of the Law! Doth not <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7.1. aſſure us, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>that the Law doth Lord it over a man,</hi> ſo long as he continues under it as a Covenant? And how doth the Law as a Covenant Lord it over the man, but by ruling in the Authority and Sovereign Dominion of God, in and by which it will at laſt judge the man? And oh! with what rigor and compulſion doth it rule over his Conſcience, and thereby reſtrain him from ſin, and conſtrain him to duty! Again, (2) Doth not the Law receive much Authority and force from the Spirit of God ſetting it home on Conſcience, and thereby terrifying and wounding the ſinner? (3) Is there not alſo in all men under the firſt Covenant a ſinful Weight or Bent of Luſt, which makes the yoke of divine Precepts extreme irkſome and burdenſome to them? And doth not this adde much to the rigour and ſeverity of the Law? Doth not the Law of God lay the ſame rigorous reſtraint on the luſts of thoſe who are under it as a Covenant, which the Providence of God lays on the luſts of Diabolick ſpirits? And oh! what a miſerable caſe are ſuch in, who lye under this tyrannick compulſion of the Law as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant! If their luſts rage within, but dare not vent themſelves, becauſe the Law holds a rod over Conſcience, how do they burn like fire in an Oven, and now and then flame forth in rebellious thoughts againſt God and his Law, wiſhing there were no Law! Or elſe, if luſts break forth into Act, how ſoon doth the Law bind over Conſcience unto wrath and condemnation! and oh! what ſtings and torments follow hereon! And is it not alſo a miſerable caſe for the ſinner to be compelled and forced by the Law to do thoſe good offices which he really hates? Would it not be a great torment to a Saint to be conſtrained to bow down and worſhip the Devil? and is it not as great miſery to a perſon under the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to be compelled by the Law to worſhip God, whom he hates, as much as an holy man hates the Devil? And is not this the genuine cauſe of all that hypocriſie which is lodged and deeply radicated in thoſe under the firſt Covenant, that all their omiſſions of ſin and performances of Duties proceed meerly from the violent tyrannick compulſion of the Law as a Covenant? And as the Law doth by its rigorous exaction more or leſs prevail on Conſcience, ſo their hypocriſie is more or leſs radicated and refined. Oh! how par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and inconſtant are ſuch in their abſtaining from ſin and performing Duties! How diſagreeable are thoſe good works they do to their Natures and Principles! and thence how little pleaſure and delight do they find in the doing of them! Yea the rigour and tyranny of the Law over ſuch moſt eminently appears in this, that in conſtraining and forcing men to duties, it is ſo far from giving ſtrength, that the more they perform du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the leſs ſtrength they have to perform them; the more they hear, meditate, or pray, the leſs ſtrength they have to perform thoſe duties as they ought: So alſo for the Laws reſtraining ſuch from ſin, the more they are reſtrained, the ſtronger their luſts grow, and break forth with greater violence in the iſſue: Whereas one under the ſecond Covenant, the more the Law reſtrains his luſts the weaker they grow, and the more it conſtrains them to duty, the ſtronger they grow in the performance of them; becauſe together with the reſtraints and conſtraints of the Law there is conveyed a force and ſtrength by the Promiſe to abſtain from the ſin forbidden, and to perform the duty required. So much for the compulſion of the Law.</p>

It's true the Law as a Cryſtal glaſs diſcovers the ſoveraign holy pleaſure of God forbidding ſin; but doth not the luſtful bent of mens hearts affect ſin even becauſe forbidden? And the Law diſcovering unto ſuch the pravity and vitioſity of ſin, how do their hearts boil up with hatred againſt the Law, becauſe it ſtrikes at ſin, wherein they place their chiefeſt good? Again, when the Law comes to put a bridle and curb on their Luſts, are they not hereby like an untamed Colt the more enraged and furious? And is not this the genuine reaſon, why ſuch as live under the cleareſt and brighteſt promulgations of the Law, oft have their luſts boiled up to the higheſt pitch? Yea, is it not hence that the unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſin takes its firſt riſe, namely from the luſts of ſuch, who living under bright notices and diſcoveries of both Law and Goſpel, and receiving ſome taſtes of good things to come, at laſt continuing ſtill under the firſt Covenant have their luſts more irritated by the Law?</p>

It's true, the Law may ſometimes irritate ſin, even in ſuch as are under the New Covenant, yet it is not from any dominion it has over ſuch, neither doth this irritation ſo far prevail, as to bring forth fruit unto death, as it doth in thoſe under the firſt Covenant, who are under the complete dominion of the Law, unto whom it hath no other uſe but to exaſperate and improve their luſts.</p>
            <p>And as the Law, ſo alſo the Goſpel, and all the means of Grace,<note place="margin">To ſuch as are under the firſt Covenant, the Goſpel and all other Bleſſings prove Curſes.</note> yea all the Providences of God, and comforts of this life prove ſnares and curſes to ſuch as are under the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.

O! what ſweet attractives and cords of love are there in the Goſpel to draw the ſoul out of its miſerable and ſinful ſtate unto eternal Beatitude! And yet, lo! how is this rich odor of life turned into a peſtiferous odor of death, to ſuch as are under the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant!

                  <hi>1.</hi> Its differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the firſt Covenant.</note> We ſhall begin with the Differences between the firſt and ſecond Covenant. (1) In the firſt Covenant, God dealt with man in a way of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Empire and Dominion, mixed with infinite Wiſdom, Juſtice, Benignity, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of Grace, though without the leaſt dram of Mercy; there was indeed ſomething of Grace in appointing the Reward, but nothing of Grace in the infallible conduct thereto: But now in the ſecond Covenant, the principal motive and Fountain that gave origine thereto was free Grace, and Bowels of warm tender Mercies: what was the foundation of this Covenant but the abſolute and ſoveraignly gracious pleaſure of God? Were there any <hi>Objective Ideas</hi> of good, any reaſons, grounds, or motives foreſeen by God, which moved him to give grace to <hi>Jacob</hi> rather than to <hi>Eſau?</hi> Did not <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> ſtand on equal ground as to Divine Election? <hi>Was not Eſau Jacobs brother, ſaith the Lord? Yet I loved Jacob and hated Eſau,</hi> Mal. 1.2, 3. It's true, the free Grace of God hath deep Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in it ſelf, but yet no reaſons or motives without it ſelf to move or rule it in its egreſſes towards the creature. Yea, doth not the Grace of God find as much and as good reaſons in <hi>Eſau,</hi> as in <hi>Jacob,</hi> in <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> as in <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> in the worſt as in the beſt of Men by Nature? Yea, what more agreeable to the Methods and Deſigns of Grace, than this, to ſhew mercy to the vileſt of ſinners? How oft doth the free grace of God take hold of ſuch as are moſt graceleſs? and whence do all the Iſſues of grace in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant flow, but from Gods tender bowels of mercy? Was it not by meer grace, that this Covenant of Grace fell from God? Yea, is not Chriſt himſelf as Mediator of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb facs="tcp:52030:6"/> an admirable inſtance and effect of Gods free Election and Grace? It's true, Chriſt as God falls not under an act of the divine Will, becauſe then he were not God, but yet as Mediator he doth: Was not his firſt Deſignation to office an act of ſoveraign grace? Did he not alſo become Incarnate by an act of free Grace?

               </hi> 42.4? And when Chriſt had obeyed and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the full, was not God the Fathers Acceptance of all an act of free Grace? It's true, Chriſt paid a valuable price for all the mercies he purchaſed for ſinners; but yet whence comes it that all this ſhould be made over to us? what made way for the commutation of perſons, that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt ſhould become ours, and our ſins by Imputation become his? was not this all from free Grace? Has not <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> in his incomparable Tractate, <hi>Of the Predeſtination of Saints,</hi> excellently well demonſtrated this, that Chriſt the Mediator of the New Covenant fell under the free Election of God? Now if the Election of the Head and Prince of the Covenant, who is God Man, was an act of free Grace, then will it not neceſſarily follow, that all the Federates, Conditions, and Effects of this Covenant, can flow from no other fountain than the ſovereign Grace of God? (2) Another Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the firſt and ſecond Covenant may be taken from the generic Idea of both: what was the firſt Covenant, but a <hi>Covenant of Friendſhip</hi> between the Creator and the Creature, where neither part was at variance? but what is this ſecond Covenant, but a <hi>Covenant of Reconciliation</hi> between a ſin-revenging God and rebellious ſinners? (3) Do not alſo theſe two Covenants greatly differ in their <hi>Terms</hi> and <hi>Conditions?</hi> What is there to be found in the firſt Covenant, but <hi>conditional Promiſes to Grace?</hi> but are there not in this ſecond Covenant <hi>abſolute Promiſes of Grace?</hi> Was not the Righteouſneſs of the firſt Covenant to be in our ſelves, without the leaſt imputation from any other? but is not the Righteouſneſs of this ſecond Covenant to be found in Chriſt only, and ſo made ours by Imputation? Did not the firſt Covenant require perfect Obedience as a Condition an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to the acceptation of the perſon? But doth not this ſecond Covenant accept an imperfect evangelic Sincerity as a conſequent of the perſons being accepted? In the Covenant made with <hi>Adam,</hi> was not the Acceptation of his perſon grounded on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of his works? but in this ſecond Covenant is not the perſon firſt accepted, and then the works for the perſons ſake? Is not this fully exemplified in the different accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> Gen. 4.4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the former ſtanding on the firſt Covenant, and the latter on the ſecond? (4) To paſs by other Differences, as to the <hi>object, foundation,</hi> and <hi>duration,</hi> are not theſe two Covenants greatly different as to their <hi>effects?</hi> The firſt Covenant diſcovers what we are to do, but the ſecond enables us to do it: the firſt is a glaſs to diſcover our ſin and miſery, but the ſecond is a glaſs that diſcovers the remedy, as alſo applyes the ſame. Of what uſe is the firſt but to declare men guilty and curſed? but doth not the ſecond pronounce pardon and bleſſing? Was not the firſt given and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to diſcover ſin? but is not the ſecond given to cover it? Doth not the firſt wound and terrifie? but doth not the ſecond heal, exhilarate and chear? Is not the firſt the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of death, and a killing letter? but is not the ſecond the Miniſtration of the Spirit, and that which makes alive, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7? Why was the firſt given, but to check, reſtrain and humble the old man? but is it not the principal Intendment of the ſecond to conſerve and quicken the New man? Doth not the firſt accuſe and condemn? but doth not the ſecond excuſe and abſolve? In the firſt, Man is bound to God, but in the ſecond God is bound to man; the firſt generates bondage, but the ſecond Liberty: And is there not a ſpirit of bondage ſuitable to that ſtate in all ſuch as are under the firſt Covenant? but O! what a ſpirit of Liberty belongs to all ſuch as are under the ſecond Covenant! and what different effects attend theſe different ſpirits! Doth not the firſt Covenant make a legal ſpirit, upon any great diſcovery of God, to flie from him as an enemy? but how doth the ſecond Covenant cauſe an evangelic ſpirit, under all the great diſcoveries of God, to flie unto him! Yea doth not the legal ſervile ſpirit, who longs to be under the firſt Covenant, ſecretly wiſh there were no law to rebuke him, no hand of Juſtice to puniſh him? but doth not the Evangelic ſpirit, who hath by means of the ſecond Covenant the Law writ in his heart, delight therein as a Rule, though he hates to be under it as a Covenant? How ſour and diſguſtful are all divine ſervices to a legal ſpirit? but how ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant are they to an evangelic ſpirit? Legal ſpirits give God much ſervice for <hi>Quantity,</hi> but
<pb facs="tcp:52030:6"/> how little for <hi>Quality,</hi> and <hi>Spirituality?</hi> But the Evangelic ſpirit gives peradventure not ſo much for Quantity, but yet much more for Quality and Perfection: Laſtly, the legal ſpirit makes all his good Offices matter of vain-glory and fuel for his pride; but the Evangelic ſpirit ſees cauſe to be humbled and ſelf-abaſed for his beſt ſervices. Such are the different <hi>ſpirits, effects,</hi> and <hi>fruits</hi> that grow out of thoſe two oppoſite roots the Old and the New Covenant, which greatly demonſtrate the boundleſs differences between the two Covenants.</p>

                  <hi>3.</hi> The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace made primarily with Chriſt.</note> which alſo will give us a further Demonſtration of its excellence. The Apoſtle inſtructs us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>that Chriſt is the Seed,</hi> to whom the <hi>Promiſes</hi> or Covenant was primarily made: by <hi>ſeed,</hi> ſome underſtand <hi>Chriſt Perſonal,</hi> others, <hi>Chriſt Myſtical,</hi> but we may, with our Author,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.16.</note> very ſafely take in both ſenſes, underſtanding it primarily and principally of <hi>Chriſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal,</hi> who is the prime Federate, and thence of <hi>Chriſt Myſtic, Abraham</hi> and his believing
<pb facs="tcp:52030:7"/> ſeed, conſidered as members of Chriſt, with whom the Covenant was primarily made. Now this Covenant as made with Chriſt terminates on him under a two-fold reſpect: (1) In relation to his own <hi>Mediatory Office:</hi> (2) In relation to his <hi>Body</hi> the Church, as he is Head thereof. (1) As it regards Chriſts Mediatory Office, and his more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat diſcharge thereof, ſo God the Father by donation and ſtipulation conſtituted him Mediator and Surety of this Covenant, gave him a promiſe of Aſſiſtence, Deliverance, Acceptance, Juſtification, Exaltation, and ſucceſs in the management of his Mediatory Kingdom: This part of the Covenant belongs ſolely to Chriſt, wherein his members have no ſhare, albeit much benefit thereby. (2) There is another part of this Covenant made with Chriſt primarily, which regards him as Head of his <hi>body myſtic:</hi> For look as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> as a public perſon and repreſentative head received both a <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Image</hi> to communicate to his poſterity, who were both <hi>legally</hi> and <hi>naturally</hi> in him; ſo alſo this our ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> received both a <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Image</hi> for his ſeed to be imparted to them. Are not all the promiſes made primarily to him, and in him to his members? And if there be any promiſe to be fulfilled, muſt not thy ſoul look up to Chriſt and his worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs alone for its fulfilling? Is not the righteouſneſs of the Covenant laid up in him, and by virtue of union with him made ours? Is there any dram of the holy oil of Grace im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to us, but what was firſt poured out on the ſacred head of this our High Prieſt? Do not alſo all the priviledges of the Covenant primarily belong to him, and to us only as in him? Haſt thou any duty to perform, and muſt thou not look up to Chriſt for ſtrength to perform it? Doth it not belong to him only to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ive ſupplies? Or haſt thou any ſervice to be accepted, and can it be accepted any other way than as perfumed with the Incenſe of his Merits? Are not all the ſons of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> by ſin cut off from all communion with God the Fountain of all good? Can they then receive any good thing from him but by the hand of this Mediator? Doth God give the leaſt good to any ſinner immediately? Have ſinners any thing to do with God in a way of mercy immediately in themſelves? If we ſpeak a good word of prayer to God, or he ſpeak a good word of comfort to us, muſt it not be in and by the <hi>Angel of his preſence?</hi> Are not all debts paid in him? all duties performed by him? all bleſſings conveyed through him? Have we then any thing to do with or receive from God in a covenant way, but by this Mediator and union with him? Did not God from all Eternity give his Son as the foundation of this Covenant to the Elect, as alſo give them to him as a ſeed? And is not this the true import of their <hi>being elected in him?</hi> Is it not alſo hence ſaid, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. <hi>That eternal life was promiſed to the elect before the world began?</hi> How could it be promiſed to them, but by this Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption with Chriſt their Head? Did not the Church, Chriſts myſtic body lie hid in him from Eternity, as <hi>Eve</hi> lay hid in <hi>Adam</hi> her head? Are not all Believers by the Covenant of Grace in Chriſt, as by nature we are all in the firſt Covenant? And is not Chriſt in every Believer as <hi>Adam</hi> in all his natural ſeed? How is the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in us, but as the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal cauſe of our nature and its moral vitioſity which cauſeth death? And is not Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> in all Believers as the original cauſe of their reſtauration and life? What is there good in man but what is firſt in Chriſt as the original Head of the Covenant and public Receiver? Wouldſt thou ſee Gods love and grace ſtreaming towards thy ſoul? Muſt thou not then firſt ſee it lodged in Chriſt as the Fountain of all? Doſt thou deſire to ſee all thy ſins wiped off? Muſt thou not then ſee them firſt wiped off from Chriſt thy Repreſentative? Wouldſt thou by a previſion of faith ſee thy ſelf in a glorified ſtate? O then by faith look on Chriſt the Head of the Covenant as glorified for thee. Alas! if thou look on thy ſelf in thy ſelf, growing out of thine own natural root, what art thou, but as a branch cut off from the Olive-root? But O! how comfortable and ſweet is it to ſee thy ſelf crucified, acquitted, and glorified in Chriſt the Head of the Covenant! Yea, doth he not only become a ſurety for us to God, but alſo a ſurety for God to us? And O! how much doth this engage ſinners to exalt this glorious Head and Mediator of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant! Was not this the grand deſign of God in making this Covenant, that his Son the Prince of it might be in every thing exalted? Why are all the promiſes of the Covenant diſpenſed firſt unto him, and all the duties of the Covenant required firſt of him, and of us in him, but that he may have the preeminence in all things, and a <hi>name above every name?</hi> That the Son of God and Lord of Glory ſhould by his own conſent, in the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption between him and the Father, come under an act of Gods will, and undertake in the fulneſs of time to take upon him <hi>the form of a ſervant,</hi> to pay debts, who never owned any; that he that was Lord of the Law, ſhould be made under the Law; that all the Elect ſhould have their names tranſcribed out of the Fathers <hi>book of Election,</hi> into <hi>the Lambs book of life, Rev.</hi> 13.8. yea, have their names written in his heart from all Eternity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

So again, when God renewed this Covenant with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> after their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> what varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth he uſe? Is not the very Prologue to it, touching their deliverance out <hi>of the houſe of bondage,</hi> an illuſtrious Symbol to mind them of their miſerable ſtate by the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? What were all the Sacrifices but federal Symbols repreſenting to the life mans ſin and miſery under the firſt Covenant, and reconcilement to God by the ſecond? So alſo for the moral Precepts, with which this Moſaic Covenant was uſhered in, of what uſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment were they, but to make way for the promulgation and advance of free Grace, as <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> made way for Chriſt?

               </gap>, which properly ſignifies a <hi>conditional Covenant,</hi> depending on the mutual ſtipulation of both parties. (2) If the Covenant of Grace be <hi>conditional,</hi> either theſe Conditions are included in the Covenant, or not: if included, then it is as to its intern diſpenſation and mind, abſolute; if not included, then is this Covenant equally as hard, yea impoſſible to Sinners, as the Covenant of Works. (3) A condition in a Covenant ſtrictly taken denotes a moral Efficience, and has a cauſal influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon what is conditionally promiſed; which deſtroys the freedom of Grace. (4) The principal difference between the Covenant of Works and of Grace lies in this, that the former was <hi>conditional,</hi> given to Grace received, but this is abſolute, giving Grace: The firſt Covenant ſuppoſed grace, but gave none; this ſecond gives all grace, but ſuppoſeth none as precedent to its gift. (5) Yet we deny not but that there are Conditions, and conditional Promiſes appendent to this ſecond Covenant; but they are ſuch as belong principally to the extern form of it, as before: or, if they belong to the ſubſtance of the Covenant, they are onely <hi>conſequent, improper Conditions,</hi> abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely undertaken for by the Head of the Covenant, and effectually wrought by the Grace of the Covenant; not <hi>antecedent proper</hi> Conditions, ſuch as beſpeak the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant conditional.<note n="[4]" place="margin">Certain and immutable.</note> Hence it follows, that the ſecond Covenant is moſt ſure and immutable, as to all the Heirs of ſalvation: He that is once in Covenant, is ever ſo: There is no way of ſecuring Promiſes and Covenants among men, but the God of all Grace hath aſſumed the ſame to aſſure us that his Covenant is moſt certain and invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable. Doth a Promiſe confirmed by Sacrifices and Oaths make ſure a Covenant? and has not God confirmed his Covenant by all theſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.5. <hi>Lev.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18? Is a <hi>Surety</hi> a <hi>Surety</hi> to make good Covenants? And has not God made this Covenant primarily with Chriſt our Surety, that ſo in him it might be firm to all his members? So much for the Nature of this Covenant.</p>

               <note place="margin">An account of the Reviſe of this Diſcourſe.</note>Having given this Summary of the two Covenants, we ſhall conclude this Proeme with ſome account of the endeavours we have put forth to render the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe more perfect and uſeful; which was penned as delivered in a popular way of Sermons, but I gave my ſelf the liberty of caſting it into this method of <hi>Books, Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Sections</hi> and <hi>half-Sections,</hi> as that which to me ſeems moſt natural, proper, and adequate to its matter: For I have long thought it one of the moſt principal concerns in Method, to follow the conduct of Nature in ſuiting our Form to our Matter, and not our Matter to our Form, as the Schools are wont. The <hi>Additions</hi> I have made, which are not many, regard principally the Explication of ſome few Texts and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
<pb facs="tcp:52030:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> of Latin Sentences, for the uſe of vulgar Capacities. As for <hi>Diminutions,</hi> I have religiouſly avoided more than ſeemed neceſſary, to make the ſence and Contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture clear. And whereas I gave the Subſcribers a promiſe, <hi>to review the Copy, and take care that it be well done,</hi> what endeavours I have exerted, yea how many hours I have borrowed from my natural Refreſhments to make good this my word, is not meet for me to mention; only the Reader may judge ſomewhat hereof, if he conſider how many Imperfections muſt unavoidably attend ſuch Poſthumous <hi>Tranſcripts,</hi> and that out of <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> written in Characters; and I am apt to perſwade my ſelf, the Subſcribers, when they have conſidered the whole, will not think themſelves deceived in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, ſpecially if they compare this with other pieces of our Author, formerly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed out of his own Notes. And I have herein endeavoured to fulfill that great Effate of our Lord, <hi>To do as I would be done unto,</hi> in the like caſe: I judge ſome guilty of much unkindneſs to their deceaſed Friends, as well as injuſtice to the World, in thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth Poſthumous Works, without due emendation and correction.

                  <p n="1">§. 1. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Covenant God made with <hi>Adam</hi> there was a Life promiſed, of which the Tree of Life was a Seal; and there was a Death threatned, which was ſeal'd by the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. In the threatning, <hi>Thou ſhalt die,</hi> the Promiſe is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>This do and thou ſhalt live;</hi> and therefore the one is called the <hi>Sacrament of Life,</hi> and the other the <hi>Sacrament of Death.</hi> And this was a Covenant not made with <hi>Adam</hi> as a particular perſon, but as a <hi>Repreſentative,</hi> from whom all Mankind were to deſcend by Natural Generation; and therefore God did make a Covenant with Man in his Head. But the Covenant God made with the Angels was Perſonal, becauſe they were created all at once; and they were not to have their Being by deſcent one after another. Hence it is that in <hi>Adam</hi> all ſin, and in <hi>Adam</hi> all die;<note place="margin">Rom. 5.12. 1 Cor. 15.12. Act. 17.26.</note> becauſe God did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make of <hi>one blood all Nations:</hi> Now the Covenant being made with <hi>Adam</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of his Poſterity; and he breaking it, brings himſelf and all his Poſterity under the guilt of Sin, and under the power of Death, which is the curſe of the Covenant. So that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works did not ceaſe by the fall;<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.1.</note> but it ſtands ſtill in force unto all thoſe that are as yet in the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. This will clearly appear if we conſider, that God dealt with man in a Covenant-way in his Creation. Man ſtands bound to God by a double bond of Creation and ſtipulation; the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52030:16"/> one is natural and neceſſary, and the other voluntary. Thus God binds the Creature to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by all imaginable engagements, to prevent future Apoſtaſie. By the one we are bound to God, and by the other God is bound to us. God as a Creator has abſolute Soveraignty, but yet that man might not think much to yield obedience, God is pleas'd to engage himſelf to a recompence. The Covenant God made is double according to the twofold ſtate of Man. (1) In his ſtate of <hi>Integrity.</hi> And this was <hi>faedus amicitiae,</hi> a Covenant of friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween perſons never at variance: (2) In his ſtate of <hi>Corruption.</hi> When man by ſin had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the firſt, and brought himſelf under the Curſe thereof, then God brought in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of reconciliation, and that was <hi>faedus miſericordiae,</hi> that is, a <hi>Covenant of mercy.</hi> And theſe Covenants were made with two repreſentative heads, the firſt and the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> for in them the Lord looks upon all mankind; and it is a mans being in either of theſe that brings him under either Covenant: for God will deal with men both in a way of Sin and Righteouſneſs, by way of imputation; and the ground of all imputation is union. In the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> all ſin, and all die; becauſe by their union they ſtand under his Covenant; ſo in the ſecond. <hi>Adam</hi> we are made the Righteouſneſs of God in him. We are in him, therefore we are righteous in him; we live in the Lord, and die in the Lord; and hence it is that to all thoſe who are in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt Covenant ſtands in force to this day; for <hi>Adam</hi> was a publick perſon, a head that repreſented all Mankind. The Commandment belong'd to the Nature; the Tree of Life was not a perſonal Sacrament, but given to the Nature; and the curſe of the Covenant doth not ſeize upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s perſon, but the nature of man in him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. And the duty of the Covenant muſt be as large as the curſe of the Covenant, and ſo large muſt the Covenant it ſelf be. Now the curſe comes upon all Mankind, therefore to them the duty did belong, and they are federates in this Covenant; all that are the Sons of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> are all under <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant. And this will appear from the conveyance of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin in the guilt of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12, for upon whom the curſe is inflicted, unto them the ſin is imputed; death came in by ſin. But how is it that they die who never ſin'd? Though they never ſin'd in their own perſons, yet in their head they ſinned. Men are in <hi>Adam</hi> two ways, <hi>Legally</hi> and <hi>Naturally;</hi> now ſeeing his ſin is imputed to us, becauſe we ſtood under the ſame Covenant, then ſo long as a man ſtands guilty of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin (which he does till he be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into Chriſt) ſo long he is under <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Every man that is under the curſe, is under that Covenant that inflicts the curſe: but all Mankind by nature are under the curſe; therefore the curſe is the curſe of the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;<note place="margin">Joh. 3. ult.</note> and the Goſpel does not make men miſerable but leaves them ſo. <hi>He that believes not on the Son ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abides on him;</hi> that is, only by accident, as the mercy of it is contemn'd; ſo indeed it heightens the ſin, and aggravates the condemnation: but the curſe is properly the curſe of the firſt Covenant, the Goſpel in it ſelf ſpeaks nothing but bleſſing. As a Phyſician that is ſent to cure a man, if through the malignity of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, and the frowardneſs of the Patient he caſt away the Potion, the Balm that would cure him, he dies of the Diſeaſe, not of the Phyſick. Chriſt came voluntarily under a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note> and ſubmitted to all the obedience of it; and <hi>he was made a curſe for us;</hi> that is, in our ſtead, to redeem us that were under the Law. It cannot be meant of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, for that the <hi>Galatians</hi> were never under; and it cannot be meant of the Law as a rule for direction, and as a bridle for reſtraint: therefore it muſt be meant with reſpect to the Law in ſome way as a Covenant; not as a Covenant of Grace, therefore as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To be freed from the Law as a Covenant is a ſpecial fruit that the Saints have by Chriſt and by his Death, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13, <hi>He delivers us from the curſe of the Law:</hi> now a man can never be freed from it as a curſe, that is not freed from it as a Covenant; we are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law condemning, but under Grace pardoning, juſtifying and accepting; or elſe (as <hi>Beza</hi> and others have it) under the Law irritating, (as the dam makes the waters ſwell the higher) but under Grace, not only pardoning and juſtifying, but healing and ſanctifying. And this follows upon the Law as a Covenant broken; and if this be a ſpecial priviledge, that men have by being in Chriſt, then they that are out of Chriſt are under the Law as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſtill; for <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſs.</hi> The righteouſneſs that the Law requires is to be found in Chriſt alone; therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> Law was to be laid up in the Ark: Chriſt came not to aboliſh the Law, but by his obedience to fulfil it, and eſtabliſh it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. From the dealing of God with all men anſwerable to the Covenant under which they ſtand; and his different dealing with them ſhews their different Covenants: (1) He exacts perfect and perſonal obedience in their own perſons. There is indeed in the Goſpel <hi>commutatio perſonae,</hi> a <hi>commutation of the perſon;</hi> but <hi>non Juſtitiae, not of the righteouſneſs:</hi> but no unregenerate man can attain to this; his Covenant admits no Mediator. So that Chriſt's obedience goes not to perfect his, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12, <hi>Without Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. (2) He rejects their beſt works for the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52030:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> leaſt failing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.11, 12. but under the Covenant of Grace, if there be but a willing mind it's accepted, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.18, 19. (3) He hates the perſons for the works ſake, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. but under the New Covenant he loves the ſervice for the perſons ſake. He had reſpect to <hi>Abel</hi> and his offering; the weakneſs of the ſervice did not cauſe the perſon to be rejected: He never hates their perſons when he is angry with their works, but he deals with unregenerate men under another Covenant. (4) All things are turn'd into a curſe; for this Covenant being broken, ſpeaks nothing but curſe, as we ſhall ſee when we come to ſpeak to the Sanction, or the appendix, that which is added unto the Covenant to inforce obedience, which is but accidental in caſe of diſobedience, and that is, <hi>in the day thou eateſt thereof dy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ng thou ſhalt die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">§. 2. But before we ſpeak to this particular, let us note theſe things by the way: (1.) Why doth God add this threatning unto <hi>Adam?</hi> ſurely it was that he might by it be deterr'd from ſin, and kept in obedience to the Covenant. All the threatnings in the Word ſince the Fall, are but conditional; which argues, that it is to no other end but that they might be avoided and prevented. He tells us the danger before that we may eſcape. God under the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant will'd that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have continued in his obedience, and avoided the curſe of it: and the Lord to manifeſt he neglected no means to this end, created in him a holy nature, gave him a righteous and an eaſie Law, made a glorious promiſe to his obedience, added a fearful threatning upon his diſobedience; therefore God did not will the death of a ſinner.

                     <note place="margin">Lam. 3.33.</note> but as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſays of the earneſt prayers of Gods people, ſo I may ſay of importunity in ſinning, <hi>Coelum tundimus, We aſſault Heaven;</hi> he ſays, <hi>Miſericordiam,</hi> I put it <hi>vindictam extorquemus; We extort vengeance.</hi> (2) But God had decreed the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and that this curſe ſhould come, and it could not have been againſt his will: how can it be ſaid then that God will'd his obedience and continuance therein? There is good ground for a double will of God, which the Scripture ſpeaks of, a <hi>will of complacence,</hi> and a <hi>will of efficacy: approbationis &amp; effectionis,</hi> a <hi>will of approbation and of effection:</hi> the one is a general and a conditional will, manifeſted to the Creature, whereby the Lord approves and rewards obedience and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance therein in all perſons whomſoever. And this is his revealed will, without determining any thing of particular perſons in whom he will work this obedience. But the other is a ſecret will toward that particular perſon in whom he will work this obedience, and to whom he will give grace to continue in it. God did in his revealed will manifeſt to <hi>Adam,</hi> what he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of him, what he delighted in, and what he would reward him for; but he did not tell him that he would give him grace and a ſupernatural aſſiſtance to cauſe him to continue in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; but he left him to the mutability of his own will, and in the hand of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. God wills, <hi>that all men ſhould be ſaved and come to the knowledg of the truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 2 4. God wills that all men ſhould believe, but he will not work faith in all men; He wills that all men ſhould be ſaved, but he will not bring all men to Salvation; he wills the one <hi>voluntate approbante,</hi> by a <hi>will of approbation;</hi> but the other <hi>decernente,</hi> by a <hi>decreeing</hi> will: So <hi>Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> his anſwer to Gods love to Mankind, <hi>pag.</hi> 220. (3) Threatnings and Promiſes are of great neceſſity and uſe, even to a creature in the ſtate of Innocency: with whomſoever God will deal in a Covenant-way, even the pureſt Creatures may and ought to make uſe of them, and to fear to offend God, becauſe of his wrath; for even, <hi>our God is a conſuming fire.</hi> Now of what uſe could this have been to <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, having no ſenſe or fear of ſin or ſuffering? but more of this afterwards. (4) Even the Creature in the ſtate of innocency has nothing in it to ſatisfie the Holineſs of God; he gives a command and adds a promiſe; but as if the Lord were jealous of him he adds a threatning to keep him in obedience: and ſo he did with the Angels, he put no truſt in them, <hi>he charges even them with folly,</hi> Job 4.18. though not with actual, yet with poſſible folly. The beſt Creatures as Creatures are change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; therefore the Holineſs of God can never take full contentment and ſatisfaction in any thing but in Chriſt, who is by the perſonal union impeccable. (5) How comes it to paſs that this Tree proved ſo hurtful to man? That <hi>totum genus humanum per infinitam ſucceſſionem per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diderit;</hi> It <hi>deſtroyed all mankind throughout ſuch an infinite ſucceſſion. Luther</hi> propoſes the queſtion, and ſays, the cauſe was not in the fruit, for <hi>fructus protulit nobiliſſimos,</hi> it <hi>produced moſt excellent fruit;</hi> but the ground was in the Word of God, and his prohibition: <hi>Arbor vitae vivificat virtute verbi promittentis, arbor ſcientiae occidit virtute verbi prohiben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis;</hi> the <hi>tree of life vivifies by virtue of the word promiſing, and the tree of knowledge kills by virtue of the word prohibiting.</hi> It's the Word of God that is the cauſe of life and death to the Creature; God exalts his. Word above the beſt of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and it is dearer to him than <hi>Adam</hi> was in Innocency, or the Angels; he has exalted it above all his Name: Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away rather than a tittle of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will not now ſpare us for the breach of it. But why did God give <hi>Adam</hi> this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment?
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52030:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> having given him ſo freely all the other Trees of the Garden,<note place="margin">Preceptum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploratorium. <hi>Paraeus.</hi> Arhor diviri cultus fuit.</note> why ſhould he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid him this one? it was <hi>a precept for trial, a tree of divine worſhip.</hi> They were not one tree, ſays <hi>Luther,</hi> though here ſo called collectively, but <hi>Nemus, quaſi ſacellum quoddam,</hi> a <hi>wood, as it were a Chappel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God loves to try the obedience of the beſt of his Creatures, to give them matter and occaſion to exerciſe the Graces that he has given them. As every word of God is a tried word, and has been in the furnace often, and Gods people have found it true; ſo every grace wrought by that word is a tried grace, and the trial of it is to the Saints now (and ſo it ſhould have been to <hi>Adam</hi>) precious, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, <hi>The trial of your faith is more precious than gold.</hi> (6) But what need had <hi>Adam</hi> of ſuch a Tree, being he had a Law written in his heart of obedience to all Gods requirings? (as the Sun has a law of motion) He was freely and fully carried after it by a command within, he was a living Scripture, a walking Bible; but yet the beſt of the Creatures had need, as of daily aſſiſtance and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo alſo of daily admonition, and a publick Monitor. The Angels themſelves as they have new ſervice daily to do for God; ſo they have a new ſupply from the ſpirit of Chriſt to quicken them daily. We read in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.13. there is a ſpirit of fire that goes up and down amongſt the living creatures, which denotes the active daily and vigorous ſupply of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, and the conſtant working of it. Surely men may ſee, yea thoſe that are learned in the School of Chriſt, what need there is of a Miniſtery. Some ſay, what need is there to have the ſame things taught, that we know as well as they do, and may be better: Yet though you do know them, there is need we ſhould ſtir you up by way of remembrance. (7) But why ſhould it be ſo great an offence to eat of this Tree, ſeeing God made it pleaſant to the eye and good for food, and a Tree in it ſelf very lovely and deſirable? It was only the will of God that made it ſo to be, becauſe the Lord had forbidden it; and it's the will of God that is the only rule of the obedience of the Creature: therefore things are good becauſe God wills them, and therefore evil becauſe he forbids them; for 'tis the will of God that is the rule of goodneſs. There is a vanity in the creature to diſpute the commands of God; we take it ill and as an intrenching upon authority to have our commands diſputed, much more may the Lord. It was <hi>Abraham</hi>'s honour he did not reaſon <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> Rom. 4.19.<note place="margin">

WHatever is excellent or deſirable in Scripture is comprehended under the name of life; and by death is comprehended whatever is evil, and whatever may make the creature miſerable. The thing threatned being death in general, not this or that particular death or evil, therefore we muſt underſtand it of all kind of death; and this I ſhall branch under theſe heads: Firſt, <hi>Temporal</hi> death; and that conſiſts in theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>All the Creatures are curſed to him;</hi> and that in theſe regards:</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) He loſt his right to all the Creatures that were given him for his uſe. God gave <hi>Adam</hi> an inheritance, and put all in ſubjection under his feet; but by ſin he forfeited them all, that he has not a right to the bread that he eats, nor to the air he breaths in. There is indeed a right of providence and a right of promiſe that man has to the Creatures: but neither of theſe a man has from the firſt, but both from the ſecond Covenant; the one as the Providential Kingdom, and the other as the Spiritual Kingdom is in the hand of Chriſt. It is as Chriſt employs them in the world, and ſo gives them theſe things as a reward of their ſervice, and their portion in this life: or elſe they have them by patience only, as a condemn'd man has
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52030:17"/> many comforts till his execution, but cannot claim them by any right; and ſo it's with them: for he that had forfeited both foul and body, muſt needs have forfeited all things elſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Creatures are given him by a new Covenant-title: they are all Chriſts,<note place="margin">Pſal. 8.6, 7. Heb 2. Iſa. 49.8.</note> and by him diſpenſed to ſome as Sons, and to others as Servants, as he is pleaſed to imploy them. For it's by his Covenant that the Earth is eſtabliſhed, that it doth not periſh, and all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in it by vertue of that Curſe, <hi>Curſed be the ground for thy ſake.</hi> Now if a curſe upon man would bring him to deſtruction, then a curſe upon the Creatures (had not a ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant come in) would have wrought their annihilation. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Judas</hi> by tranſgreſſion fell, that he might go to his own place. <hi>Judas</hi> had no place of his own but Hell; and Chriſt himſelf ſtanding in a curſed condition, though he were Lord of all, yet he was in the world as one that had right to nothing. He became poor, had not a houſe to lay his head in, nor an Aſſe to ride on, but lived upon the benevolence of his ſervants: He had not a Chamber to eat the Paſſover in. And when he died, whereas all men have their Graves, he had none but another mans. But how was it that Chriſt the heir of all things, ſhould be ſo in want, but as he ſtood under our Covenant, and came under our curſe, and did repreſent our perſons; and therefore it's ſaid, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.26, <hi>That the Meſſiah ſhall be cut off not for himſelf.</hi> So we read it.<note place="margin">Dan. 9.26.</note> But others read it, <hi>Et nihil erit ei, He ſhall have nothing, he ſhall have no inheritance in his life, and ſhall die as if there were no hope in his death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">(2) All the Creatures deny their ſervice to him: <hi>When thou tilleſt the ground it ſhall not give its ſtrength;</hi> that's a fruit of the curſe upon the Creatures for man's ſin; <hi>the Sun ſhall refuſe to give its light, and the Clouds their rain, and the Heavens their influence:</hi> and that we have any of theſe, it's by virtue of the ſecond Covenant; it's by Chriſt that the Sun ſhines, and the rain falls upon the juſt and the unjuſt. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19, <hi>I will betroth thee unto me; and then the Heavens ſhall hear the Earth, and the Earth ſhall hear the Corn and the Wine:</hi> then all the Creatures ſhall give their fruit and influence. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19, 20, there's a <hi>bondage of corruption,</hi> from which the Creature deſires to be delivered; by which I think is not meant diſſolution, for ſurely no creature but deſires its own preſervation; therefore I judge it's meant of ſervice and ſubjection, in being ſubordinate to the luſts of wicked men. And although the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelves be made for ſervice, and of their own natures rejoyce and triumph in it, as <hi>the Sun does rejoyce as a Giant to run its courſe:</hi> yet ſince ſin came into the world there is ſuch a ſympathy in the Creature of the wrong done to God thereby, that the Creatures would withdraw themſelves, the Sun would cloath it ſelf with ſackcloth, and the Moon be turn into blood; the Stars would withdraw their ſhining, and all the reſt would do ſo alſo, but that the Lord has ſubjected them in hope of a reſtauration and a glorious condition that they ſhall have, even a new Heaven and a new Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And God makes the Sun to riſe upon the evil as well as on the good; but upon the evil for the ſake of the good. And were God's people taken all out of the wilderneſs of this world, the Creatures ſhould be delivered and ſerve the luſts of wicked men no more. And therefore the Sun was withdrawn at the death of Chriſt, not that it could not behold ſuch a horrible ſight, (as ſome do expreſs it); but it was in wrath, to ſhew that he was under the diſpleaſure of God, to whom he crys out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> and all his Diſciples forſook him and fled, and not an Angel lookt out of Heaven to comfort him.</p>

                  <p n="4">(4) Whatever they have by the Creatures ſhall be with much toil, labour and wearineſs: <hi>In the ſweat of thy face thou ſhalt eat thy bread.</hi> We ſee how much toil and labour the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-man has to put ſome life into the dead earth; all things are full of labour,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 1.8.</note> man cannot utter it; and how much wearineſs there is in every calling and condition of life, nay even in our very Recreations, how much pains there is to extract a poor ſmall contentment, that even the pleaſure of it does nothing recompence the labour to get it, God having made the Creatures even like to <hi>Paracelſian</hi> Phyſick, a little ſpirit mixt with a great deal of unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table matter; a great deal of droſs with a little gold, and much chaff with a little corn, and a great deal of labour before a man can beat it out.

                  <p n="1">(1) They ſhall affect Dominion, and make great ſtirs and diſturbances in the World, and bring great miſeries upon the People that their luſts may be ſatisfied, and they ſhall rule ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their will, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.8, 9, <hi>Nimrod began to be a mighty hunter in the earth.</hi> And <hi>Jer.</hi> 16.16, <hi>I will ſend for many fiſhers, and many hunters,</hi> that ſhould be all for the prey, and take all the people, and bring them into ſubjection to them.

                  <p n="4">(4) And they are alſo inſtruments to ruin themſelves by their wickedneſs, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms in which they rule.

As Kingdoms were caſt off in <hi>Rome</hi> for the abominations of their King. <hi>There was a great Star that fell from Heaven, and his name was called wormwood, and the third part of the waters were become bitter, and many periſh'd in his downfall.</hi> It were not harſh to ſay, that moſt of the Magiſtrates that ever have been rais'd up in the world, have been given to a people in wrath, as <hi>Saul</hi> was; and even their perſons being ſuch as they are, have been fruits of the Curſe, have been given in judgment, and proved very great ſcourges to the Nations where they lived.</p>

                  <p n="1">(1) The people ſhall flatter the Magiſtrate, which is a great judgment,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 5.11.</note> and by this means he ſhall lift up himſelf to his own deſtruction, and they willingly walk after his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It's a judgment to a people to have a Magiſtrate command what is evil willingly; ſo it is to a Magiſtrate to have the people willing to obey any thing, be it never ſo evil: to be as a lump that receives any leaven. This was the riſe of Antichriſt, and the great judgment, that the Kings gave their Kingdoms to the Beaſt, <hi>and all the world wondred after the Beaſt,</hi> Rev. 13.3. To worſhip Kings as amongſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> to ſet them up as Gods is baſe flattery.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) A ſpirit of jealouſie and murmuring of the people againſt them. God ſent an evil ſpirit between <hi>Abimelech</hi> and the men of <hi>Shechem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Judg. 9.23.</note> that they were full of nothing elſe but jealouſie and diſtruſt one of another; full of murmuring and complaining. If any evil befall them, by and by ſtone <hi>Moſes;</hi> if he deliver them it is that he may make himſelf altogether a King over them, and put out their eyes that they may ſee nothing. Don't we ſee how things are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd all for your own advancement? as <hi>Corah</hi> and his Company ſaid. And when he had wrought the greateſt deliverance for them, yet they cry out, That he did bring them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> out of envy, becauſe there were no graves there; it was but to bury them in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs: as a ſick Patient ſays to a Phyſician, ſurely you mean to kill me, when all his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour tends to cure him.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) Sometimes they rebell againſt the Magiſtrates, and diſobey their Commandment; endeavouring by force to caſt off their Government: As <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s Conſpiracy with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt <hi>David</hi> his own Father, beſides all the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were with <hi>Abſalom.</hi> And in <hi>Rehoboams</hi> time, <hi>To your Tents, O Iſrael, let David take care for his own houſe, what porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have we in David, and inheritance in the ſon of Jeſs,</hi> &amp;c. If <hi>Sheba</hi> the ſon of <hi>Bichri</hi> the moſt obſcure man do but blow the Trumpet, and ſay we have no part in <hi>David,</hi> all <hi>Iſrael</hi> will be ready to deſert and fall off from their loyalty and allegiance. As the meaneſt man ſhall have power enough to make a party againſt Government. And men will forſake them when they are in danger and ſtand in moſt need of them: as when the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> came againſt <hi>Saul</hi> and made war againſt him, all the people were ſcatter'd from him. And ſo others if danger come the people leave them to themſelves, after all their care and pains with the greateſt faithfulneſs beſtow'd upon them.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4) God many times leaves Magiſtrates for the peoples ſins, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.1, <hi>The Lord was angry with Iſrael, and he moved David againſt them, to ſay, Go number Iſrael and Judah. David</hi> is left to this ſin, but it was the Lord's anger againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> that did provoke him
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52030:20"/> thereunto, that by this ſin he might bring upon them the judgment, <hi>Ob peccata populi labitur princeps;</hi> and therefore <hi>Peter Martyr</hi>'s obſervation is, <hi>That the people may much help and aſſiſt their Magiſtrates in Government; Orando &amp; recte vivendo, by prayer and wel-living;</hi> and therefore when the people neglect theſe, <hi>Saepe a Deo deſeruntur,</hi> the <hi>Magiſtrates are oft left by God, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3ly, The Curſe is alſo come upon the relation of Husband and Wife. (1) When a Wife ſhall become a ſnare to a mans ſoul, and be to him but one of the Devils darts, a Serpent in his boſom. 'Tis ſaid in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.20. <hi>There was none like Ahab, who ſold himſelf to work wickedneſs, whom Jezabel his wife ſtir'd up.</hi> To have a Wife inſtrumental to further the luſt of her Husband in what kind ſoever, what a ſnare is that? for her to entice him to the worſt of evils, Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. (2) When a Wife ſhall be falſe to her Husband in the Marriage bed. <hi>Thy wife ſhall be a harlot in the middle of the city,</hi> is threatned as the Husbands Curſe, <hi>Amos</hi> 7.17. And <hi>Job</hi> 31.10, <hi>Let my wife grind to another man, &amp;c.</hi> And for a man to miſtruſt his Wife; <hi>Keep the door of thy lips from her that lies in thy boſom.</hi> (3) When a Wife ſhall be an enemy to Religion, and a ſcoffer, as <hi>Michal; How glorious was the King of Iſrael to day, when he was uncovered before the maids?</hi> And for <hi>Job</hi>'s Wife to joyn with his friends, yea with Satan againſt; <hi>Doſt thou ſtill retain thy integrity? curſe God and die.</hi> It's queſtion'd why the Devil ſhould ſpare <hi>Job</hi>'s Wife when he took away his Goods and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? there is ſurely more comfort in a Wife than in all things in this world. The reaſon gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is, becauſe he did intend to make her an inſtrument to perſwade her Husband to curſe God, hoping to conquer him by her. And how this evil in a Wife imbitters the ſpirit of a Husband, and what animoſity it raiſes in him againſt her, and what ſuſpicious thoughts, and what eſtrangement this does uſually work in their minds one from another, we many times by experience find.</p>
                  <p>And the Husband alſo becomes a Curſe to the Wife: (1) By a ſpirit of jealouſie over her, which though ſometimes it may be upon juſt ground and cauſe given in the Wife; yet ſometimes it may be cauſleſs, as appears, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.12, 13. We ſee what great care the Lord did take of Marriage-Chaſtity, it being his own Ordinance, he did appoint an Offering and a water of Jealouſie; the one to be offered to the Lord, and the other to be drank by the Woman accuſed. And if ſhe were guilty her belly ſhould ſwell, and her thigh rot; and if guiltleſs ſhe ſhould conceive ſeed and become fruitful: ſo that it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cauſleſs, and yet a ſpirit of Jealouſie might come upon a man. A Wife made a Croſs is the greateſt croſs; and made a ſnare is the greateſt ſnare, and the moſt dangerous. And when a man grows vile in the eyes of a Wife for any weakneſs in him, either inward or outward, as <hi>Nabal</hi> did, <hi>His name is Nabal, and folly is with him.</hi> And <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, <hi>My breath is ſtrange to my wife, though I intreated for the childrens ſake of my own body,</hi> Job 19.17. Jealouſie is the rage of a man, it makes him bitter to her, takes every thing in the worſt ſenſe, not bearing with ordinary and common failings, incident to perſons in that ſtate. Bitterneſs in words, ſharp and piercing ſpeechees and actions, ſavouring of tartneſs and want of that tenderneſs and love that ſhould be in a man towards his own fleſh. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16, <hi>Thy deſire ſhall be ſubject to thy husband, and he ſhall rule over thee.</hi> The woman was created to be a help to the man, and the woman created for the man, and not the man for the woman; and therefore a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination and a kind of ſubjection there was before the fall, but not ſuch as now after the fall. Indeed the <hi>Civilians</hi> ſay, that Marriage is, <hi>Perpetua quaedam ſervitus,</hi> a <hi>conſtant ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:</hi> only before the fall (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays) it was <hi>ſervitus dilectionis,</hi> a <hi>ſervitude of love:</hi> but ſince the fall it is <hi>ſervitus conditionis,</hi> a <hi>ſervitude of condition.</hi> Before the fall it was with much ſweetneſs and love, their wills never claſhing; they both joyned in the ſame good, and will'd the ſame thing: but now there is much oppoſition and much contrariety of will. And yet it is the bondage that God has laid upon the Wife; ſhe muſt be ſubject to her Husband, and have no will of her own; but even <hi>her deſire muſt be ſubject to him:</hi> not only ſubmit her acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons but even her will alſo, which is of all other the greateſt ſubjection. It's ſaid of <hi>Jacob,</hi> though he was a holy man, that God ſaw that <hi>Leah</hi> was hated by him, which at beſt cannot be interpreted but of a leſs degree of love, and that there was more ſharpneſs in his carriage towards <hi>Leah</hi> than there was towards <hi>Rachel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">(2) When the Husband deſerts and forſakes his Wife, being raviſh'd with a ſtrange woman, and imbracing the boſom of a ſtranger, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.20. And we read in <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15, 16. the great miſery thoſe poor women were ſubjected to, for the Husband making uſe of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which is not a toleration but a limitation: not that putting away was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52030:21"/> 
                     <hi>(for the Lord hates putting away),</hi> but for the hardneſs of their hearts, ſeeing they did put them away; for the womans diſcharge he was to give her a writing of Divorce. But by this means their wives, <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>cover'd the altar of God with tears:</hi> ſo that when they came to offer Sacrifice, that ſin came up into remembrance before God, that their Sacrifice could not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend; and the Altar was not cover'd with that, but with the <hi>tears of their wives,</hi> which they had in a cruel and wicked manner, by their deſerting them, cauſed them to ſhed, <hi>dealing treacherouſly with the wife of their youth: ſhe that is thy companion and the wife of thy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> They had great complaints againſt their wives, and were able to find out many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to put them away, when they had ſinfully found out others, that their luſt carried them to: and ſo they did cover violence with a garment. But the Prophet bids them take heed to their ſpirits, and look upon the falſeneſs of their own hearts in it, that they deal not treacherouſly and falſly, and ſo break their Covenant with their wives, even <hi>the Covenant of their God.</hi>

                  <p n="3">(3) By puting them upon occaſions of ſin; and ſo they are made inſtruments to ſatisfie the luſt of their Husbands.

                  <p n="4">4. Between Parents and Children: 1. Children are curſes to Parents. <hi>Thou ſhalt be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the fruit of thy body, as well as in the fruit of thy land.</hi> (1) By diſeſteem, making them vile in a mans eyes,<note place="margin">Deut. 27.16.</note> 
                     <hi>Curſed be he that ſets light by father or mother;</hi> and this proceeds further even to mocking and deriding, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.17, <hi>The eye that mockes at his father or mother, the ravens of the vallies ſhall pick it out.</hi> (2) By forſaking them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3. <hi>without natural affections:</hi> the word in the <hi>Greek</hi> is a ſimilitude taken from a <hi>Stork,</hi> which takes ſpecial care to provide for and maintain the Parent when it's old. But <hi>Mar.</hi> 7 11. they taught Children a way to cheat their Parents by dedicating their Eſtates to the Temple, or the publick ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and then when the Parent ſhould ſtand in need of any part of it, the child ſays it is <hi>Corban,</hi> a thing dedicated, and therefore he muſt not meddle with it, and ſo do nothing for him. (3) There is a ſeeking their Fathers life, as <hi>Abſalom</hi> did <hi>David</hi>'s, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe the young man well for my ſake,</hi> ſays the father; but when <hi>Huſhai</hi> ſaid, <hi>We will ſmite the King only;</hi> the ſaying pleas'd <hi>Abſalom</hi> well. And the ſon ſhall betray the father to death; <hi>Sennacherib</hi> was ſlain by his two Sons. (4) The parting with Children at death and not knowing in what condition a man ſhall leave them, is a great part of a mans vexation. In this life it's a great part of the Curſe, <hi>His Sons come to honour and he knows it not, they are brought low and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders it not, &amp;c.</hi> That was <hi>Luther</hi>'s comfort in his Will, <hi>Lord, thou haſt given me Wife and Children,</hi> and I give them to thee again; <hi>Qui pater es pupillorum &amp; judex viduarum,</hi> which art the Father of Orphans, and Judge of the Widows. But the contrary is a very great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction unto the hearts of Parents, and a great part of a mans miſery, that Children muſt ſuffer for the Parents ſins, and God may viſit the iniquity of Parents upon Children to the third and fourth Generation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Parents alſo are a Curſe to their Children: (1) The ſins of Parents are tranſmitted to the Children. We ſee <hi>Adam</hi> did bring a Curſe upon himſelf and all his poſterity, and the infants of <hi>Sodom</hi> were involved in the puniſhment of the ſins that they were not in themſelves guilty of;<note place="margin">Ezech. 4.25.</note> God reſerved the puniſhment of the Fathers for their Children for three hundred and ninety years together. <hi>Chams</hi> ſins and <hi>Canaans</hi> is puniſht nine hundred twenty-five years
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52030:21"/> after; and <hi>Gehazi</hi> his Leproſie cleaves to him and his poſterity; and the <hi>Jews</hi> in Crucifying Chriſt, ſay, <hi>his blood be upon us and our children;</hi> and ſo wrath is come upon them to the uttermoſt for many Generations. [1] This is a puniſhment upon the Parent, and a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of great wrath, that not only Judgment comes upon himſelf, but upon his poſterity. [2] It's only in Temporal things, for an Eternal Curſe never comes upon Children, but for their own ſins; but for Temporal Curſes they are diſpens'd in a way of prerogative, and the Lord will lay thoſe Curſes upon Children which the Parents did deſerve, and they are gone down to Hell to receive. (2) Parents prove ſnares and plagues to their Children by betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their liberties, loſing of their priviledges, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto them were committed the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God.</hi> Now when they ſhall forfeit them and part with their priviledges by little and little. What a curſe is this? The Ordinances and the Truths of the Goſpel are the greateſt truſt committed to Parents, but when they provoke the Lord to call them <hi>Loammi,</hi> and to caſt them off, then they are forfeited. As <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>the natural branches are broken off, and their poſterity are caſt out as an abominable branch:</hi> only the Lord will in time graft them in again. So many a Father does loſe glorious priviledges and opportunities for his Children. <hi>Saul</hi> did diveſt himſelf of the Kingdom and all his poſterity, <hi>Now would I have eſtabliſhed the Kingdom to thee, &amp;c.</hi> (3) By an evil example,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.18.</note> corrupting them by their vain converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion received by tradition from their Fathers, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.17, <hi>We will burn incenſe to the Queen of Heaven as we have done, we and our fathers, our Kings and our Princes in the cities of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, &amp;c.</hi> (4) The Father may forſake his Son, yea, he may forget, <hi>When my father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forſake me,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt, <hi>the Lord takes me up.</hi> And the Father may betray the Son to death, as we ſee <hi>Saul</hi> did <hi>Jonathan;</hi> if he will not comply with his luſts he ſhall not live; he throws a <hi>Javelin</hi> at him to kill him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p n="1">§. 1. WE have thus far conſidered the firſt Branch of the Covenant's Curſe, and that conſiſts in <hi>Temporal death:</hi> Now let us come to conſider the ſecond Branch of it, which is <hi>Death Spiritual,</hi> and that is <hi>All the ſpiritual evil that can befal the ſoul of man in this life, whether of ſin or ſorrow.</hi> And it's as poſſible for a man to weigh the fire, and to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the wind, and number the ſtars, or count the ſand upon the ſea-ſhore, as to reckon the particulars wherein this Death conſiſts. Godly men that ſtudy the evils of their own hearts all their days, yet cry out, <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things, who can know it?</hi> Jer. 17.10. The word ſignifies an <hi>incurable diſeaſe;</hi> its only the Lord that can cure and ſearch it, and know the malignity of it. And as it is ſaid of Vertue and the beauty of Holineſs, if it could be ſeen with bodily eyes, <hi>Mirabilem excitaret amorem ſui,</hi> it <hi>would ſtir up a wonderful love of it ſelf:</hi> ſo could the death of the ſoul and the evils of it be ſeen, it would ſtir up hatred and amazement above all things in the world. A godly man that ſees but a little of it, when God opens his eyes, he abhors himſelf and loaths his own ſoul, <hi>Job</hi> 42.6. And <hi>Luther</hi> bleſſed God, that he did not ſhew him ſin all at once, but by degrees; it would have ſunk him with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of it. This will be the ſtudy of men in Hell to all eternity to rake into this filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſoul and the death thereof: for Hell is the grave of the ſoul, and the rottenneſs of it ſhall be ſtudied there for ever. And this ſhall be the work of that never-dying worm, the ſouls reflection upon it ſelf and its own loathſomeneſs, and to loath it ſelf for ever.</p>
                  <p>Conſider (1) the ſoul is the darling, and therefore the beauty of a man; and the worth of the man lies in the hidden man of the heart, which is in the ſight of God of great price, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3. and therefore the deformity of the ſoul is the greateſt. The worth of the man is from the worth of the ſoul, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.20, <hi>The heart of the wicked is little worth:</hi> His Lands and his Honour, and his Cloaths may be worth much in the eſteem of the world, but his ſoul is worth nothing. Therefore the value of a man is in his ſpirit, though there be other things that we commonly prize men by, yet thoſe that judge aright count the Saints upon this account the excellent ones, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3. and all others to be vile men how great and rich ſoever, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. And a man does proſper truly as his ſoul proſpers, 3 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. and not as his body proſpers, or as his eſtate proſpers. Therefore a man is filthy if his ſoul is filthy, and vile as his ſoul is vile; and he decays as his ſoul does from day to day. (2) The great difference between men and men lies in their ſpirits. <hi>Caleb</hi> had another ſpirit, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.24. Our diſtinctions for the preſent are but for a time, and death will make all equal; that as we were all made of one body, ſo we ſhall all be diſſolved into the ſame duſt; they are all but for the time of this life; the Princes robes and the beggars rags lie down together, but the difference in their ſpirits is eternal, and therefore the bleſſing or the curſe upon the ſoul
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52030:22"/> is much more than that on the body or the eſtate: many of theſe being but for the time of this life. (3) Sin is chiefly an act of the ſoul. The ſin of the ſoul? <hi>membra ſunt arma,</hi> the <hi>members are but weapons;</hi> it's the ſoul that's the hand, and the chief cauſe of enmity lies therein; and therefore the chief vengeance lights upon that. God will puniſh ſin not only here, but eternally: Therefore as the greateſt bleſſing is upon the ſoul, ſo the greateſt curſe alſo. And as the School-men ſay of <hi>Glory,</hi> ſo we may ſay of <hi>Wrath,</hi> it is <hi>Radicaliter in corde, redundanter in corpore,</hi> radically in the heart, but redundantly in the body; the main object of wrath and curſe is the ſoul.<note place="margin">2 Pet. Mat. 16.</note> (4) The great evil that ſin does a man, it fights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his ſoul; and the great loſs that it occaſions is the loſs of the ſoul, men do often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of loſſes, but they may be all made up in this life, as <hi>Job</hi>'s were; or if not, yet the <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of this preſent life are not worthy of the glory that ſhall be reveal'd; they work for us a more exceeding and eternal weight of glory:</hi> and, <hi>Quaedam amittere ut majora lucreris non a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſio eſt ſed mercatura;</hi> to <hi>loſe ſome things that thou maiſt gain better is not loſs, but a thriving trade.</hi> But the loſs of the ſoul is the great loſs that can never be made up, and therefore the curſe of the ſoul is the great curſe. (5) The curſe of the ſoul being taken off all other cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are taken off alſo; as the curſe remaining on the ſoul all bleſſings are turn'd into curſes: they may be bleſſings in the thing, but they are curſes to the man. So on the other ſide all curſings are turn'd into bleſſings: they may be curſes in the thing, but they ſhall prove bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to the man. <hi>To the unclean all things are unclean, for their minds and conſciences are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed,</hi> Tit. 1. When once Grace comes into the ſoul malediction goes out; all things ſhall work for your good, and the curſe is taken off from all the Creatures for your uſe. Life is yours, and death is yours; ſo that as the precept of the Law is made a ſervant to the promiſe of the Goſpel; (for it was added by way of ſubordination and ſubſerviency thereunto;) ſo the curſe of the Law is made a ſervant to the Grace of the Goſpel alſo: and a Saint has a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified uſe of that as a bleſſing, which is in it ſelf a curſe. (6) The chief ſatisfaction that was given for ſin has reference to the ſoul. In the ſacrifice there was offred the life and the blood; but it was the blood that made an atonement for the ſoul, and <hi>without ſhedding of blood there is no remiſſion.</hi> And when Chriſt came to ſtand in our ſtead as a ſurety, the main of the ſufferings he endured were in his ſoul,<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.10.</note> 
                     <hi>God made his ſoul an offering for ſin.</hi> Chriſt did as our ſurety, and therefore he put his name to our bond, and was made under the Law. Now being our ſurety he was to pay our debt; and that was mainly in the ſoul. The Sacrifice that was to be accepted of God was to be a whole burnt-offering: now if Chriſt had but ſuffered in his body it had been but a half burnt-offering. <hi>He offered himſelf,</hi> Heb. 9.10. therefore it muſt be his whole manhood: and before his bodily ſuffering came, while he was in the Garden, he ſays, <hi>My ſoul is heavy unto death,</hi> Mar. 14.33. <hi>amazed</hi> or <hi>aſtoniſhed:</hi> the word is rendred, <hi>a failing of ſpirit:</hi> his ſpirit died even within him, his thoughts were wholly abſtracted from all things elſe, and the wrath of God that lay upon him did wholly fill up his ſoul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now in all theſe reſpects the curſe upon the ſoul which is ſpiritual death, is the greateſt part of the Curſe far greater than that upon the body, upon Creatures or Relations.</p>
                  <p n="2">§. 2. And now let us come to conſider wherein this Curſe upon the Soul lies.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It lies in this, <hi>That a man has forſaken God as his chief Good, and as his utmoſt End.</hi> Man in his Creation was carried towards God, as that chiefeſt Good, wherein his happineſs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted; and acted towards God as him to whom all his actions were refer'd, and wherein his bleſſedneſs lay: and therefore <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſpeaking from a ſpirit renew'd and having the ſame principle begun in him, ſays, <hi>Omnis copia quae non eſt Deus inanis egeſtas eſt; All plenty that is not God is poverty.</hi> And <hi>Bernard</hi> ſays, <hi>Animam Dei capacem quicquid eſt Deo minus non im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plebit; nothing leſs than God will fill the ſoul capable of God.</hi> Man having all in God muſt needs do all for him, and refer all to him: for he that is the chief Good muſt needs be alſo the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt End. Now the death of the ſoul lies mainly in this firſt, it's taken off from God as the chief Good; for that's the firſt thing ſin does, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14. it draws a man away from God, who was the Center where the ſoul reſted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.7, <hi>Return to thy reſt, O my ſoul. They have forſaken their reſting place, they have wandred upon every mountain.</hi> And therefore <hi>Jude v.</hi> 18. all the luſtings and inclinations of the ſoul they are call'd ungodly luſts, becauſe they have nothing elſe in them, that being the main bent in them all, to take off the ſoul from God and carry it away from him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.13, <hi>It's forſaking the fountain of living water.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12, <hi>It's departing from the living God.</hi> And hence it is that repenting is call'd returning, becauſe we have departed from him; and converſion is nothing elſe but returning to God as a mans chief Good. And man being thus departed from him, <hi>God is not in all their thoughts:</hi> for they look for no good from him, their good lies not in him, and therefore they live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the world; they know him not, they love him not, they expect nothing from him; it's to them as if there were no God to judge, nor reward; and hence it is that men can live without the favour of God all their life-long, and never be troubled, becauſe they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52030:22"/> have not made it their happineſs. But take a man that has ſet up this as his happineſs, a frown is to him as the meſſenger of death, and not to ſee the Kings face puts him into the ſhadow of death; for he can breath in no other air: as <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſaid, <hi>He could not live unleſs he ſaw the Kings face.</hi> And ſo <hi>David, God had hid his face, which made him like to them that go down into the pit.</hi> Man in his Creation as he was wholly of God, ſo he was wholly for him; and ſo it is when the Image of God is renewed: <hi>None of us lives to himſelf,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 14.9. 1 Cor. 10. ult.</note> 
                     <hi>nor dies to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; Whether we live we live to the Lord, and whether we die, we die to the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> But nature never aims at God in any thing, makes him neither the end of his being, nor of his working: if he labour in his Calling and get an Eſtate, he is laying up treaſures for himſelf; and is not rich towards God: and in his Religious duties, if he pray, <hi>he howles for Corn and Wine.</hi>—If he faſt, <hi>Have you faſted to me, ſays the Lord? and when you did eat and drink, did you not eat to your ſelves?</hi> And when they preach it's to themſelves: ſome preach Chriſt out of envy, and to draw diſciples after them. Some ſelf-end or other is the great wheel in all they do that acts them, and carries them on: and if they do reform with <hi>Jehu,</hi> it's upon a politick principle, and not a pious; not for God but for themſelves: and ſo <hi>dum obtemperant, non obſequuntur,</hi> whiles <hi>they obey they obey not;</hi> and in all the duties of Religion Self is at the bottom, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.11, <hi>They are as a heifer that loves to tread out the corn.</hi> And if like the Phariſee they faſt, or give almes, it is to be ſeen of men; God is not in all their thoughts, nor his glory in all their aim; and they are ſaid to ſerve other things as Mammon, and ſerve di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers luſts and pleaſures. Now what is ſervice but to do anothers work, and to do it to their ends, to be wholly theirs: therefore Chriſt is ſaid to be God the Fathers ſervant, becauſe he did the work that God gave him to do, and he aimed at Gods ends alſo; he did not ſeek his own glory, but the glory of him that ſent him: and Grace is in this reſpect in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner call'd ſelf-denial, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24, <hi>Let a man deny himſelf;</hi> and Self in ends is hardeſt denied of any other. <hi>This is great Babel that I have built for the honour of my Majeſty.</hi> And thus the ſoul is taken off from God, it has no happineſs in him as the chief Good, they live not to him, they act not for him as their utmoſt end; he is neither the end of their being, nor of their working.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Soul has loſt his intereſt in God. There were glorious relations between God and man by Covenant, ſo that as God had an intereſt in man, ſo had man alſo an intereſt in God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. ult. <hi>Adam</hi> was the ſon of God, and had that intereſt in God that became that relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as a child has an intereſt in a father, and he could truly call him his God: and this is the glory of the ſecond Covenant, that our intereſt in God is reſtored and increaſed; <hi>I will be their God and they ſhall be my people,</hi> Jer. 31.33. And he that has an intereſt in another may claim him according to his relation, as truly as if all were in his own power; as the Wife has an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Husband, and ſhe may expect that love, care, and protection and proviſion that that relation does intitle her to, as truly as if it were in her own power; and the Husband may expect from his Wife that love, ſervice and help that the relation calls for. And it's true of all other relations whatſoever, when perſons have a relation and an intereſt one in another; and though the perſons be of the higheſt rank, as between a King and a Subject, a Maſter and a Servant, a Father and a Son, yet the relation gives them a mutual intereſt one in another: and ſo man had in God at the firſt, he was his God; and the Saints now call him in Chriſt, the <hi>God of my mercy,</hi> and the <hi>God of my life;</hi> and ſo man had an intereſt in the Wiſdom of God, and in the Holineſs of God, and the Soveraignty of God over all the Creatures, ſo far as might be for mans good, as truly as for his own glory; for that's the nature of propriety, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.10, <hi>Be ſtrong in the Lord and in the power of his might.</hi> I have no power, may ſuch a ſoul ſay, but I am ſtrong in the ſtrength of God, and wiſe by the wiſdom of God; all that is in God I have a claim to, I have nothing of my own, but all the Creatures of God are as mine; and therefore as having nothing, and yet poſſeſſing all things; having nothing in my ſelf and yet poſſeſſing all things in God: as <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.6, <hi>He that overcomes ſhall inherit all things; I will be his God.</hi> And therefore after all <hi>Job</hi>'s great loſſes the Fathers bring him in looking upon them all, and ſaying, <hi>I have loſt nothing.</hi> So long as the ſoul has an intereſt in God he can loſe nothing, he can want nothing: But ſin has broken all relations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and God, but barely that of a Creature, thou art no more a Son; and therefore the <hi>Jews,</hi> Joh. 8. boaſting that God was their father, Chriſt tells them, that there was no ſuch relation between God and them, but they deſcended from another ſtock, of their father the Devil. And for ſervants, they ſerve not God but themſelves, their own bellies; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all this intereſt muſt be reſtored unto them in Chriſt; <hi>I aſcend to my father and your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, my God and your God:</hi> He is no way a God to us but as he is Chriſt's God, elſe we have no intereſt in him; and if we ſin we can lay no claim to his Mercy to pardon, or to his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to direct us, or his Power to protect us, or his Bounty to provide for us; nay, all the Attributes of God that work for the good of his people, they all work againſt ſuch a ſoul;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52030:23"/> his Holineſs is a terrour, <hi>for he is of purer eyes than to behold evil;</hi> his Wiſdom is a terrour, <hi>for he knows how to reſerve the wicked to the day of judgment to be puniſhed;</hi> his Omniſcience is againſt us, <hi>for he will bring every work to judgment with every ſecret thing:</hi> He does number our ſteps, and does watch over our ſins, and the mercy of God thou haſt no intereſt in, thou ſhalt have judgment without mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a man can claim nothing that is in God to be for him. And though while men are at eaſe, and enjoy the Creatures, they find no want of this, yet when they come to die and to be in a ſtreight,<note place="margin">Act. 27.</note> as <hi>Paul</hi> was when he ſaid, <hi>the Angel of the Lord ſtood by me whoſe I am and whom I ſerve;</hi> and at the laſt day to look up to God, and ſay, <hi>I am thine, ſave me Lord,</hi> it will be more than for a man to have an intereſt and a title to all the Kingdoms of the Earth: and other men that have ſlighted it they ſhall know what it is to loſe their intereſt in God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Soul has wholly loſt the Image of God in which the glory of the ſoul did at firſt lie, but it's utterly defaced, and a new Image is now ſtampt upon us. We are all by nature the children of the Devil, and there is an image that's earthly which we do now bear, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.49. therefore we <hi>muſt be renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created us;</hi> for all knowledge and inward abilities of mind either to know God or the Creature is loſt, and the ſoul is darkneſs it ſelf, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18. dark in its principles, and dark in its reaſonings, his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is darkneſs: and though Divines do commonly ſay, that there are ſome common noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as fragments of the former image, I conceive we are beholding to the Covenant of Grace for them, and that they are preſerved in us by Chriſt, as our lives are; and the ſupport of the Creatures for our uſe, and whatever does tend to our comfortable being, whatever is on this ſide Hell, we have not as a part of the firſt Image, and from the firſt Covenant, but as an overflowing of the Grace of the ſecond Covenant, by which I ſay the world ſtands: for ſurely man fell in <hi>lutum lapidoſum,</hi> into <hi>a ſtony mire,</hi> as <hi>Bernard:</hi> the one blotted out the image of Holineſs, and the other brake in pieces all his natural abilities. It's laid for a ground, that Original ſin is alike in all; now how comes it to paſs that it has not the ſame puniſhment and power upon all? Take a natural fool, and the verieſt idiot, and every one of us was as guilty of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin as he; now why are thoſe common notions blotted out in him, and preſerved in us? ſurely it is from the different diſpenſations of the Mediator, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whoſe hand the government and adminiſtration of all things are committed; and it's ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>That he enlightens every man:</hi> there is not only a ſupernatural light from Chriſt to all the Elect, but there is ſome kind of light that even all mankind has from Chriſt by vertue of the ſecond Covenant; that it's not deſtroy'd it is from him: and that glorious freedom of Will is wholly loſt, that though man acts as a free-willer becauſe he does it anſwerable to the dictates of Reaſon; yet it is <hi>libertas adulterina,</hi> an <hi>adulterine liberty;</hi> and that which has a ſhew of liberty, but is only bondage: for ſurely that <hi>libertas contrarietatis, velle bonum vel malum,</hi> is not liberty; for that's a perfection, and ſo is not the other, neither can there be liberty in Heaven then: but now the ſoul is wholly ſervile, becauſe it can will nothing elſe but evil,—<hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. he muſt work the will, <hi>&amp;c. Facit ut velimus praebendo vires effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſimas voluntati.</hi> Aug.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Soul has loſt all fellowſhip and communion with God. <hi>Adam</hi> could walk with God, and enjoy fellowſhip as a friend with God; and ſo do the Saints that have this image renewed; but it's grace only fits a man for fellowſhip, <hi>Being made partakers of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. And ſo for glory alſo, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Eſtranged from the life of God.</hi> So call'd, either becauſe it's wrought by God, (as the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is call'd the righteouſneſs of God,) it's God that lives in the ſoul by his ſpirit; and it's the life of God by way of eminency and excellency; for things excellent are call'd the things of God: and it's the life of God, becauſe it does fit a man to walk with God, and to live to God. Now from this life men are ſtrangers,<note place="margin">Iſa. 44.20.</note> they live a natural life, and they feed upon the carnal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts that are below, that nature deſires and ſeeks after; and they live a civil life, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with men in civil affairs; but for a godly life, a life to God, to walk with God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him in all their ways, this they are ſtrangers to, this is only the life of Saints. But men live the life of ſatan; he lives in them being the ſpirit of this world, and he acts them, and with him they converſe, and his luſts they do. As <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſays of himſelf, ſpeaking of the luſts of his youthful time, <hi>Hi ſunt amici quibus acquievi, conſules quibus credidi, aves quibus cohabitavi.</hi> But for God they have no acquaintance with him in all their ways.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Soul is at enmity with God, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21, <hi>Enemies in our minds:</hi> and this enmity is twofold, either direct or collateral enmity, as when mens luſts run out to the Creatures, and the uſing of them, <hi>loco mariti,</hi> in <hi>the ſtead of an husband;</hi> it's an enmity unto God, though we intend it not, but <hi>Jam</hi> 4.4. only pleaſure in the Creature carries us on, and we prove adulterers therewith, when mens ſpirits are carried unto ſeveral luſts for pleaſure ſake, and profits ſake, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo it's enmity againſt God but indirectly, and men ſay they never meant
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52030:23"/> God any evil, I never intended it; as they in <hi>Ezech.</hi> 8.3, <hi>They ſet up the image of jealouſie to provoke me to go far from my ſanctuary:</hi> that was <hi>finis operis,</hi> the <hi>end of the work,</hi> though not <hi>operantis,</hi> of the <hi>worker.</hi> But there is a kind of direct enmity which carries a man on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which is ſimply evil, and that for no cauſe but becauſe it does diſpleaſe and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, as in ſwearing, a ſin wherein is neither pleaſure nor profit; there is no ground for it but barely becauſe God is diſhonoured by it. We read <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. there is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpighting of the ſpirit of Grace; there is an enmity to do evil for no other end but to deſpight the ſpirit of Grace, which is the great tranſgreſſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.13. There is an inclination in our nature to this great offence, unto which not only preſumptuous ſins, but even ſecret ſins are ſteps and degrees. Men reject the Soveraignty of God, and ſcorn his Laws, and deſpiſe his power and judgments, deny his being and exalt themſelves above him, ſaying there is no God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Souls death lies in this mainly, that it hates, and is an enemy to all thoſe ways that might bring him back unto God again, reſiſts whatever may reconcile God and his ſoul; let but a good thought of God come into their head, and they hate it.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.28.</note> We naturally like not to retain God in our knowledge; let any thing be offered unto us that exalts God, and we reject it, we are enemies to all righteouſneſs. Take but the offers of Chriſt, and the grace of the Goſpel, there is nothing that the heart riſes ſo much againſt and oppoſes, becauſe it's the way that brings us to God; they will find out another of their own, they deſire to be under the Law, go about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, and not ſubmit to the righteouſneſs of Chriſt. This will be the great condemnation of the World. Nay, even in a godly man, let but a little of God be ſet upon his ſoul, preſently fleſh luſts againſt it, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17.) and would extinguiſh that ſpark that the grace of God has kindled in his ſoul, but that an Almighty power upholds it; ſo that men could be content to live in this world and never know God, <hi>Job</hi> 21.15.</p>
                  <p n="3">§. 3. The curſes upon the Soul in reference to God we have ſeen; now there are others in reference unto the ſoul it ſelf, and ſome of theſe we ſhall alſo name: As firſt, God doth forſake the ſoul; for the Creature departing from God, he does alſo depart from it. There are three words uſed to this purpoſe, one is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.33, <hi>I will even forſake you;</hi> it ſignifies <hi>to caſt off the care of them, &amp;c.</hi> And another word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is properly to <hi>forſake</hi> or <hi>depart</hi> from a perſon, or withdraw his preſence, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. <hi>If you forſake him he will alſo forſake you:</hi> but the word in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.29. is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which ſignifies <hi>to caſt a man off,</hi> and <hi>to forſake him as an abomination.</hi> Now of the Deſertions of God there are ſeveral kinds, anſwerable to the ſeveral bleſſings wherein a man is deſerted: (1) There is a deſertion in the matter of actions, and then a man can do nothing, for even a godly man is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of himſelf to think a good thought: God works the will and the deed of his good pleaſure. (2) There is a deſertion in matter of Grace, and then all corruptions prevail and overflow. (3) There is a deſertion in direction, and then a mans vvay is hid, and he cannot tell which way to take, but he gropes for the way as a blind-man. (4) There is deſertion in matter of ſtrength, and then a man can bear no affliction, nor reſiſt any temptation, but his heart is weak as water. (5) There's a deſertion in part of joy and comfort, and then his heart is full of heavineſs, he walkes in darkneſs and has no light; when God does but hide his face his ſoul is troubled even to death. (6) There is a deſertion in reſpect of any outward calamity. When God leaves a man in the hand of an enemy, as he did <hi>Job</hi> in the hand of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and withdrew himſelf, took away the hedge that was about him; and when a man is left in the hands of wicked men whoſe tender mercies are cruelty, <hi>Job</hi> ſays, <hi>Chap.</hi> 29.4. <hi>The ſecret of God was upon my tabernacle:</hi> there is a <hi>ſecret of counſel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 25.14.</note> and ſo ſome expound it here for direction, God making known his Counſels to him; but there is alſo a <hi>ſecret of Providence,</hi> Gods preſence being with him as if he were peculiarly the God of his family, and had a ſpecial eye to the preſervation of his Tabernacles beyond all others. As amongſt the Heathens they had their Houſhold-Gods, ſo did the Lord ſeem to be unto <hi>Job,</hi> and the ſecret of his Providence was there, as the Lord has ſtill a ſecret of his peculiar Providence over his own, which is call'd the <hi>ſecret of the Lord.</hi> Now if the Lord deſert a man, even his own people, any of theſe ways, in what a miſerable condition do they by and by apprehend themſelves to be? There is a preſence of God required to the ſubſiſtance and being of the Creature, and therefore one has well compar'd it to a glaſs without a foot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is a Divine hand that holds it, and if the Lord do hold it, it will abide ſafe, but if God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his hand it falls, he need not ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. There is guilt upon the Soul that follows as a part of the Curſe, and is a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent and concomitant of every ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19, <hi>All the world is become guilty before God;</hi> and <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.20, <hi>He that breaks one Commandment is guilty of all.</hi> This guilt in its nature is the obligation of the Soul to bear the whole Curſe, and all the puniſhment that is legally due thereunto. There are indeed two things in guilt; (1) There is <hi>ordination unto wrath,</hi> and that is <hi>ex parte Dei, on Gods part;</hi> which the School-men call <hi>reatus perſonae,</hi> the <hi>guilt of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> the actual binding over of ſuch a man to puniſhment becauſe of ſin; and this is from God, (for the Law is good) and may be ſeparated from ſin, as in all the regenerate that are juſtified by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt it is. (2) There is a <hi>demerit in ſin,</hi> which is the deſert of puniſhment and wrath, and this is called <hi>reatus peccati,</hi> the <hi>guilt of ſin;</hi> and this is inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from ſin whereſoever it is; even in Gods people, there is a meriting of wrath in their ſins, as well as others: But unto all men that are under the firſt Covenant, both theſe by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the curſe of it do concur; there is a demerit in the ſin, and there is an actual obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to puniſhment upon the perſon. There are two things in ſin, there is the act and the guilt; the act with the pleaſure of it is fading, the pleaſures of ſin that are but for a ſeaſon; but there is an abiding guilt upon the ſpirit that is after a ſort infinite, being an offence againſt an infinite God, a violation of an infinite Holineſs, and a contempt of infinite Majeſty and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and it is alſo eternal and will remain upon the Creature for ever, and nothing in the world but the Blood of Chriſt can take it away from the ſoul,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.7.</note> being ſprinkled upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and this is the meaning of that Proverbial ſpeech, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7, <hi>Sin lies at the door;</hi> it's a ſpeech taken from a dog or a fierce beaſt that lies at the door to watch; and it teaches us three things: [1] That though the act be paſt, yet the guilt remains, binding over the ſoul to puniſhment, the ſin lies there. [2] That there is a time when ſin in the guilt and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it may lie ſtill and be quiet, and a man may ruffle it in the houſe within and never be troubled at that which lies at the door.

There are two things that men are terrified with,<note place="margin">Numb. 32.23.</note> and they look upon as enemies, the word of God and the guilt of their own ſins, and therefore men do endeavour to fly from the one, and to hide themſelves from the other; now the word follows them, and will ſurely overtake them at laſt, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.6. and the guilt of ſin that ſeeks the man; and albeit he has many a hiding place, yet ſin both in the guilt and in the puniſhment of it alſo will at laſt find him out. (3) Hence follows an evil Conſcience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. There are two things that make the Conſcience evil, it's pollution by reaſon of the filth of ſin, and its accuſation and condemnation by reaſon of the guilt of ſin; and though this indeed be mainly reſerved to the laſt day, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15, 16. when the book of Conſcience ſhall be opened, and that faculty enlarged, becauſe then it is to give up its <hi>Viatory office,</hi> and an account of the whole man that God has betruſted it with; yet it

Hence comes that fear which does torment the ſoul, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.18. that wrath will ſeize upon a man whereſoever he is, as it was with <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Every one that meets me will ſlay me:</hi> he lookt upon himſelf, as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, <hi>Tanquam excommunicatus ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualiter &amp; corporaliter, regnum amiſerat &amp; eccleſiam,</hi> as <hi>one who was excommunicated both ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually and corporally, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore he that was put out of the protection of God could look for no ſafety amongſt the Creatures; hence a man walks in the horrour of the ſhadow of death; <hi>Felix</hi> trembles, and <hi>Herod</hi> fear'd it was <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> that he had ſlain that was riſen again. There is fear on every ſide: if he walks by the way he looks vengeance ſhould come upon him, and he ſhall never again viſit his habitation, and if he abide in his houſe there is a curſe entered into the ſtones and the timber of it; when he lies down at night, he ſays, it may be this night God will take away my ſoul, and he is ſcared with dreams, and terrified with viſions, that he is not able to ſtand under the imaginations and thoughts of his own heart: if he attend upon the Word there is a ſavour of death unto death; he ſees the grave open, and this is to him a teſtimony of a further death, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. And hence is that ſhame and confuſion of face that is in men: looking upon themſelves they abhor their own image, and are not able to endure their own ſtink, ſeeing how their ſouls do breed worms, as <hi>Herod</hi>'s body did; they ſee that they are the loathſomeſt Creatures alive, and hence there is a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themſelves; and it comes at laſt to a revenge, as we ſee in <hi>Judas.</hi> And the reflections and reproaches of a mans own ſpirit he cannot bear: and he has theſe dreadful deſperate thoughts, I ſhall never find mercy, my glaſs is run, my hope is paſt, ſurely there is no mercy for me; if there were as many windows in Heaven as there be Stars, as many doors as there be ſouls, yet there would be no entrance for me. And the ſoul ſinks down under his own bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den for ever, and ſays, My iniquity is heavier than I can bear. And this is properly the death of the ſoul, it is eternal deſperation, it's hell it ſelf. I had time and means, and offers, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties and works, and motions of the Spirit of God; but the Lord has now forſaken me, and the night is come upon me, there is as much hope of the Devils as of me.

                  <p n="4">4. God gives a man up unto the power of ſin and the dominion of it; that a man is not his own, but yields up himſelf and his members inſtruments to unrighteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.18. He gives over himſelf to obey ſin and the luſts thereof; man ſells himſelf to ſin ſinfully, and God ſells him judicially, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That as a godly man is not his own, ſo neither is a wicked man: <hi>For his ſervant a man is to whom he obeys, whether it be of ſin unto death,</hi>

Every man by nature indeed does ſin freely; but ſome men are left to a judiciary freedom in ſinning, that as they cannot reſtrain themſelves, ſo God will not reſtrain them from ſinning; but they ſhall pour out themſelves to all iniquity with greedineſs, <hi>Jude</hi> v. 11. they ſhall be as wicked as they will, that ſo they may fill up their meaſure of ſinning; as Chriſt ſaid of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, <hi>Fill up the meaſures of your fathers:</hi> it's ſpoken by way of wrath and vengeance; the Lord did give them up to the power of ſin to the uttermoſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.11, <hi>He that is unjuſt, let him be unjuſt ſtill, and he that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill.</hi> This permiſſion is the higheſt and foreſt affliction. And there the Church leaves them that are obſtinately ignorant, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt inſtruction, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.38, <hi>He that is ignorant let him be ignorant.</hi> Now for a man to be thus given up by God and his Church, is a moſt deſperate condition. As it is a <hi>fearful thing to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52030:25"/> fall into the hands of the living God;</hi> ſo it's a fearful thing to be given up to his own hearts luſt. To be given up to ſin is a juſt puniſhment of ſin; for the ways of ſin, as well as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſin, is death. It's a dreadful thing for the Lord to ſay of a people appointed to wrath, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Let them go forth, ſuch as are for the ſword to the ſword, and ſuch as are for the famine to the famine:</hi> but it is more dreadful for God judicially to ſay, let them go forth, ſuch as are for drunkenneſs unto drunkenneſs, and ſuch as are for uncleanneſs unto uncleanneſs; as much as ſin is a greater evil than affliction, and as much as it is better to ſuffer than to ſin.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. God gives a man up to the power of Satan and his own will, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. The Devil is compared to a hunter, and men are by him taken alive as we do beaſts in a ſnare, and then carried whither the hunter will: though God be not the author of ſin, yet he is the orderer of it as well as of ſuffering: and as he ſets bounds unto Satan in our affliction, as <hi>Job</hi> 1.12. <hi>All that he has is in thy hand, only upon himſelf lay not thy hand;</hi> ſo he does in our temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alſo, <hi>He will not ſuffer you to be tempted above what you are able,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.13. Satan would indeed tempt you above what you are able, but God will not ſuffer you ſo to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. It's a fearful thing for God to give a man either in his body or eſtate over to the will of the Devil, as we ſee in <hi>Job,</hi> how ſad was it with him in that regard; but much more for God to give over a mans ſpirit to Satan to carry a man unto what ſins he will: then I am ſure he will be boundleſs in his ſinning, as well as in his ſuffering. It's an obſervation of <hi>Damaſcene,</hi> that it's only by ſin that Satan has acceſs to the ſpirits of men, and therefore he did tempt <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt himſelf by outward objects only preſented to the ſenſes, which is a great argument that he could not have acceſs to their ſpirits.<note place="margin">Joh. 14.30.</note> 
                     <hi>The Prince of this world,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>comes and has nothing in me.</hi> The more Satan has in a man the more immediate acceſs he has to him, and the greater power over him; therefore the leſs of Satan there is in a man ſurely the leſs power he has over him. But beſides the poſſeſſion and dominion that ſin has given him, there is a delivering a man unto Satan, a kind of ſpiritual excommunication by God himſelf; as Chriſt by a ſop gave Satan full poſſeſſion of <hi>Judas:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 13.27.</note> and though before the ſop he had it may be ſome reluctancy to that damned buſineſs, yet after it Satan had full power over him, and he goes on with a reſolution, and an impudent boldneſs, and ſays, <hi>Whom I kiſs he it is;</hi> for he was delivered over to the will of Satan to carry him unto what ſin he would. And ſo we may obſerve of the falſe Prophets in <hi>Ahab</hi>'s time, and them alſo that are mentioned in 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12. and ſuch men, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> obſerves, he raiſes to a higher degree of wickedneſs; the <hi>Devil vouchſafed them greater and fuller power:</hi> he ſpeaks it of <hi>Marcion, Valentinus,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hereticks, Satan brings them to thoſe ſins againſt God that he himſelf cannot commit.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. All Providences and Ordinances, and Operations of the Spirit become a curſe to them, and a ſnare to their ſouls; Proſperity makes them full and deny the Lord, and poverty makes them ſteal and take the name of God in vain.<note place="margin">Prov. 30.8.</note> If a man be raiſed from a low eſtate as <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Hazael,</hi> it is in wrath; and if he be preſerved in a common judgment it is in wrath: as God raiſed up <hi>Pharaoh, That he might ſhew his power on him,</hi> and ſend all his Plagues upon his heart; and if there be a Prophet ſent to <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> a judgment lights on him in his way back, becauſe he was diſobedient to the word of the Lord:<note place="margin">1 King. 13.33.</note> yet thereupon <hi>Jeroboam</hi> turns not from his abomination. Every act of Providence is to them for evil, and a ſnare to their ſouls; and all the Ordinances that they do enjoy do but ripen their ſins, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.7. there is a full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of curſe as well as of bleſſing in the Goſpel; and it's a favour of death as well as of life, and all the works of illumination, humiliation, ſeeming converſion and reformation do make them but the ſtronger enemies to God; when they fall from them all they do but prepare a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation for ſeven worſe ſpirits; for the dog to return to his vomit again: as we read ſuch a ſtory of one <hi>Euſtathius,</hi> who was firſt an <hi>Arian,</hi> and then afterwards was converted and ſubſcribed the Articles of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and was a man imployed by the Church, and endured a great Perſecution with <hi>Baſil,</hi> and divers other godly men; and yet afterward he turned again into the former Doctrine of <hi>Arianiſme,</hi> and never returned. And ſo we read of <hi>Alexander</hi> in <hi>Act.</hi> 19.33. and afterwards of his Apoſtacy; and theſe works do qualifie men for the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and make them more conformable to the Devil than otherwiſe they would be.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. There is a giving a man up to Spiritual judgments which are of all plagues the greateſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.14. As ſpiritual ſins are the greateſt ſins, ſo are ſpiritual judgments the greateſt plagues, and there is no plague like that of the heart, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.38. and we have ſo much the more cauſe to obſerve them, becauſe God did formerly under the Old Teſtament puniſh with outward and temporal puniſhments; but thoſe that live under the Goſpel are ſpecially pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Spiritual judgments; as the mercies of the Goſpel are more ſpiritual, ſo are the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments alſo: and they are (1) a hard heart; which implys three things, [1] Inſenſibleneſs of ſin and judgment: [2] Taking no impreſſion either from the Word or Spirit, and the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52030:25"/> touches of both. [3] Inflexible as an Adamant, that you cannot bow nor break it, and that heart that is a flint to God is wax to Satan; no command, nor judgment of God will break it, for it's poſſeſt with an iron ſinew; <hi>bray a fool in a mortar, yet his folly will not depart.</hi> (2) There is a ſpirit of ſlumber that a man is ſenſible of nothing, no danger can wake him; for ſleep is the binding up of all the ſpiritual ſenſes. Their eyes are cloſed and they cannot ſee; their ears are uncircumciſed and they cannot hearken; let them be ſmitten and they cannot feel it; and nothing does awaken them, neither the loudeſt cry of the Word, nor the judgments of God; a deep ſleep is upon them, and they fear no evil. (3) A ſeared Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. the word ſignifies, <hi>to ſear with a hot iron,</hi> and to make inſenſible, to have no feeling, or elſe to <hi>cut off by ſearing;</hi> ſo that men walk as if they had no Conſciences left. (4) An injudicious mind; God gives them over to a reprobate mind:<note place="margin">Rom. 1.28.</note> an injudicious mind is taken with envy, error, with every vanity, and is able to judge aright of nothing. (5) Vile affections, the baſeſt and moſt diſhonourable luſts, even ſins that are below a man, as brute beaſts therein to corrupt themſelves, and that makes them hateful and abominable to all the world. (6) A final impenitency, a heart that cannot repent;<note place="margin">Heb. 6.4.</note> and it's impoſſible for them to be renewed again by repentance.</p>
                  <p n="4">§. 4. Having ſpoken of Temporal death and Spiritual death, we ſhould now come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider <hi>Eternal death;</hi> which, as it is ſaid of the Glory of the Saints, <hi>Neither eye has ſeen, nor ear has heard, neither can it enter into the heart of man to conceive, &amp;c.</hi> it is as true of this Eternal death, no ear has heard what it is; it is called perdition and deſtruction, the ſecond death. And as Heaven is ſet out by ſome reſemblances of the glory of the things in this life, ſo is Hell in reſpect of the miſeries of this life; but all theſe are but ſhadows of the one and of the other. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.11, <hi>Who knows the power of thy wrath? as is thy fear, ſo is thy wrath:</hi> that is, the wrath of God in the dreadful effects of it is ſuch that it paſſes knowledg, and it paſſes fear. The heart of man is able to conceive vaſt fears, as it has vaſt deſires; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we can fear there is ſomething in the wrath of God anſwerable to all. But having ſpoke of this more largely elſewhere, I ſhall but touch upon it at preſent. In this death there is ſomething eſſential which befalls all that ſuffer theſe torments, and is inſeparable from it, as they do fall upon ſuch a ſubject; the eſſential part of this death the Scripture makes to be of two parts, there is puniſhment of Loſs, and puniſhment of Senſe. There is a loſs and a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a man from all good things whatſoever; there is no man but has ſome good thing in poſſeſſion, and he has ſomething of which hope gives him a reverſion: but in this death he ſhall be ſeparated from them both, and this is the privative part. This <hi>poena damni, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of loſs,</hi> is double, (as <hi>Durandus</hi> has obſerved, <hi>pag.</hi> 210.) either, <hi>in amiſſione boni habiti, vel nondum habiti,</hi> in <hi>the amiſſion of ſome good poſſeſſed or hoped for:</hi> Now by this death men ſhall be ſhut out from both: Firſt, they ſhall be ſhut out of the preſence, viſion and fruition of God for ever; there ſhall paſs upon him an <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as Divines did anciently call it, an <hi>eternal excommunication,</hi> or a <hi>non-communion:</hi> as their ſpiritual death did conſiſt in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrangement from God in holineſs, ſo their eternal death ſhall conſiſt in an eternal ſeparation from God in happineſs; <hi>They ſhall be puniſhed with eternal deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.9. and this was the great torment that Chriſt does complain of, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.46. <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> and yet it was only <hi>ſubſtractio viſionis,</hi> a <hi>ſubſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of viſion.</hi> And this is the great affliction of his people here on earth: if the Lord hide his face, <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>Hide not thy face from me, leſt I be like to them that go down into the pit:</hi> and yet this is but a hiding of his face, as an Eclipſe of the Sun for a day; he will but hide his face for a little moment, but he will have mercy on thee with everlaſting loving kindneſs: how much more when God ſhall caſt a man off in wrath for ever, and never have an eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him more! and therefore the Fathers do generally ſay, that the greateſt torment of Hell is this of Loſs; <hi>Abſentia Dei quoad viſionem omnia alia tormenta ſuperat. Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. <hi>Mille Gehennae paenas:</hi> and there is nothing ſo dreadful as to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from God, and to be hated by him.</p>

It follows <hi>to be under the Law.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of being under the Law in divers ſenſes: (1) There is a being under the Law for juſtification and life,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4, 5.</note> that is, under the Law as a Covenant: <hi>Chriſt was made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law to redeem us that were under the Law.</hi> (2) There is a being under the Law for condemnation,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.10. Rom. 6.14.</note> 
                     <hi>As many as are under the works of the Law are under the curſe.</hi> (3) There is a being under the Law for <hi>irritation,</hi> that is, ſtirring up a mans corruption; <hi>Sin taking oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion by the Commandment became exceeding ſinful.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 5.8.</note> (4) There is a being under the Law by <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, If you are led by the ſpirit you are not under the Law:</hi> that is, the Law as only infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and compelling; as an unregenerate man is, as a ſlave, and having the ſpirit of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, not of a ſon, who does all he does from an inward principle and diſpoſition ſuitable to the Law, in whatever it does command.</p>
                  <p>But it will appear that being under the Law in all theſe ſenſes are grounded on being under it as a Covenant, as we ſhall ſee hereafter; and that he that is freed from it as a Covenant, is not under the Law in any of theſe reſpects; but by vertue of the ſecond Covenant is deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it. Only here I think <hi>Pareus</hi> and others ſay, that <hi>to be under the law and deſire ſo to be,</hi> is the ſame with <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>They that are of the works of the Law:</hi> that is, that ſeek righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and life by the works of the Law; and this is properly to be under the Law as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, which was the natural ſin of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and with which error and hereſie they endeavoured to overſpread all the Gentile Churches, going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs; and therefore typified by <hi>Hagar,</hi> which the Apoſtle makes <hi>Jeruſalem that now is, and is in bondage with her children:</hi> but <hi>Jeruſalem above,</hi> the Chriſtian Church, is <hi>Sarah</hi> that did receive the Doctrine of the Goſpel without any mixture of their own righteouſneſs, but did truſt perfectly in the Grace that was revealed to them by Jeſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 10.3.</note> So here to be under the Law is to ſeek to be juſtified by the works of the Moral or Ceremonial Law, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing works of righteouſneſs that we have done. For though the whole Ceremonial Law were Goſpel under a veil, yet they not being able to look to the end of it, as the Apoſtle ſays, they did perform it as works of righteouſneſs,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.</note> in which they did expect juſtification, and life for their obedience to them, and performance of them, without looking into the things ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed in thoſe types. Now the Apoſtle ſays not only, that men were thus under the Law, but ſo <hi>they did deſire to be.</hi> Therefore looking upon theſe as being a patern of all mankind, and in whom the diſpoſitions of all men may be read, I do hence obſerve:</p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>That to be under the Law as a Covenant of works is unto every natural man a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable condition.</hi> He is not only born under the firſt Covenant, but under that Covenant he does deſire to continue. In the handling of it I ſhall firſt prove it, and give the grounds of it, and anſwer ſome Objections that may ariſe in the hearts of men againſt it, and then make the application of it.</p>
                  <p>There is in the fall of man, a double miſery come upon him. (1) <hi>His being under Adams Covenant.</hi> (2) <hi>His bearing Adams image.</hi> And in this ſtate all men by nature deſire to live and die. And that men do ſtill deſire to bear the image of the Earthly <hi>Adam</hi> is plain, becauſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52030:26"/> they reſiſt the image of God in Chriſt, that bleſſed image, that by the holy Spirit is offered to them in the Goſpel. And we find how much they do hug the image of old <hi>Adam</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Now though their deſire to be under his Covenant be the foundation of all their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, yet men apprehend it not ſo much. The offer of the ſecond Covenant they hate, and reject the Covenant of Chriſt as much as they deſpiſe his Image, yet they perceive it not: Therefore to prove it we muſt take the moſt convincing courſe we can.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, this was the evil that God ſaw <hi>Adam</hi>'s nature to be prone to, and therefore he not only caſt him out of Paradiſe, as a juſt reward of his apoſtacy, but alſo in a particular manner forbad him the uſe of the tree of life, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.22.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.22.</note> God having made for our firſt Parents coats of skins, now he ſaith, <hi>Behold the man is become like one of us:</hi> it is an Ironical exclamation, wherein God derides the falſhood of Satan, and the folly of man: This is the Godſhip that Satan promis'd, <hi>en Divinitatem promiſſam! Behold the promiſed Divinity!</hi> And the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evil was nothing but a miſerable and ſhameful nakedneſs, which before man knew not. And now here follows <hi>exilii decretum, &amp; ratio decreti;</hi> the decree is, Gods will to caſt man out of Paradice; and the ground of it is, leſt he put forth his hand and take of the tree of Life. But why muſt not man after the fall taſte of the tree of Life, ſeeing before the fall it was not forbidden? It is anſwered, <hi>Non in eſſe, ſed in intentione futurum erat peccatum, not in the action but in the intention, it was to be reputed ſin.</hi> And Interpreters give this as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that thereby God might take away occaſion of ſinning from him; and God doth not only aim at keeping us from ſin by his Word. but by his Rod alſo. And they obſerve that there was by the fall a double corrupt diſpoſition in <hi>Adam</hi>'s heart, which the eating of this tree would have drawn forth: (1) Looking upon it as a Creature which he might conceive to have a vertue in it to preſerve life; he might put forth his hand, which notes a voluntary act, and ſo he might conceive, though God hath threatned death, yet here is a tree that can preſerve life, and of this I will eat and live. And ſo he might have ſin'd wilfully, and out of contempt of the threatning of God, by deifying a Creature, and ſetting it in his place, and giving it Gods power; and ſo the life that was denied him by God, he might think to make up in the Creature as men commonly do. (2) Looking upon it Sacramentally as it was a Creature and a ſeal of the Covenant which he had broken, and in flying unto the ſeal of this Covenant, he might ſtill ſeek righteouſneſs and life thereby; if not in a natural way as a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet in a ſpiritual way as a Sacrament. And he might think the ſame Covenant remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of which he did ſtill enjoy the ſeal; therefore to ſhew that there was no way to attain life by that Covenant broken, God ſhuts him out from the ſeal of it; alſo becauſe he had appointed a way to life for man by Chriſt, a far more glorious tree of life, who is therefore ſaid to be in the middle of the Paradiſe of God. And this is a more glorious way for God, becauſe in it his juſtice ſhall be ſeen, and ſatisfaction given, and a ſafer way for man alſo; wherefore ſeeing that to the firſt tree of life he had ſtill acceſs, and the Lord perceiving in man this diſpoſition to depend on it, he not only forbids it, but placeth an Angel with a ſword drawn to keep him from it, that he might have no hopes of life in this way, either by it as a Creature, or by it as a Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards <hi>Cain</hi> was a ſon begotten in the image of his father; he offered Sacrifices, but it was not in faith, or with an expectation to be accepted in the promiſed ſeed,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.4.</note> and yet he expected to be accepted; and when he ſaw he was not, his pride was turned into rage, and great diſcontent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.5. and his countenance fell. But upon what ground did <hi>Cain</hi> expect acceptance? it was for the work done only, and therefore all unregenerate men that come to God in a legal way, <hi>Luther</hi> calls, <hi>Cainiſtas Deo offerentes non perſonam, ſed opus perſonae, Cainiſts offering to God not the perſon, but the work of the perſon.</hi> Which ſhewed plainly, that he expected to have been accepted and rewarded for his work done alone, according to the tenure of the firſt Covenant, without a Mediator; and therefore God ſpeaks to him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules of his own Covenant, (as Divines commonly obſerve) <hi>If thou doſt well thou ſhalt be accepted.</hi> This being the great difference between the two Covenants, in the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant the perſon is accepted for the works, but in the ſecond the works are accepted for the perſons ſake. And when the Lord took the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> unto himſelf as a peculiar people of all the Nations of the Earth, and entered into a Covenant with them; though God did not intend to ſet up this Law alone as a rule by which any man ſince the fall ſhould attain righteouſneſs and life, but as a Covenant of Grace with Evangelical offers of Grace to bring them to Chriſt, and therefore gave it <hi>in the hand of a Mediator;</hi> yet the Lord kept it in the form of a Covenant of Works, that it might be the more effectual to drive men to Chriſt, and ſo ſerve Gods ends. But they ſtuck to the Law as a Covenant of Works, even the generality of that people, and did ſeek righteouſneſs and life by the obedience of it; and it grew even the common ſenſe of the Nation, as we ſee it in the young man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.16. <hi>What ſhall I do to inherit Eternal life?</hi> Eternal life he thought muſt be got in a way of doing;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52030:27"/> and it was the error which prevailed amongſt the Phariſees, the moſt learned amongſt the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 3.6, 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> counted his former legal righteouſneſs <hi>gain to him, pro merito,</hi> that which ſhould bring him in a great revenue of glory at laſt. And it is recorded by the Apoſtle as the great ſin of their Nation,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.4.</note> 
                     <hi>to go about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, and not ſubmit to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God; not to look upon Chriſt as the end of the Law for righteouſneſs unto every one that believes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when the partition-wall was broken down, and God had lifted up Chriſt as an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to the Nations, the Law went forth of Zion, and the waters iſſued out of the Sanctuary, theſe were the firſt tares which the envious man did ſow, to put men upon ſetting up the Law as a Covenant, and to ſeek life upon impoſſible conditions, as by their perfect fulfilling of it; and therefore they muſt do as the Phariſees did, when they could not come up to the Law, they muſt by their own interpretations as well as their traditions, bring the Law down to them, and enervate the Law. And therefore the Apoſtle takes much pains to confute it, and to perſwade us againſt <hi>ſeeking righteouſneſs and life by the works of the Law;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 3.4. Gal. 2.3, 4.</note> and Satan being beaten out of this, then his next deſign is to ſeek to join both Covenants together, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men, <hi>to ſeek righteouſneſs and life by fulfilling the Law and believing in Chriſt alſo.</hi> And ſo partly by our own obedience we ſhall be juſtified and accepted, and wherein we come ſhort, Chriſts righteouſneſs comes in to make it up. We read in <hi>Act.</hi> 15.5. that there were ſome of the ſect of the Phariſees that did believe, and had received Chriſt as Mediator, and acknowledged him, that yet ſaid, <hi>It was needful and they ought in duty to be circumciſed, and to keep the Law of Moſes.</hi> Which Doctrine afterward the Apoſtles and the Church of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> diſavow, as a thing they had no warrant for to preach. So in <hi>Act.</hi> 21.20. there were many thouſands that believed, and yet were leavened with this error; they were all jealous of the Law, which made the Apoſtle ſpeak ſo excluſively as he does, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. <hi>Therefore we conclude, that a man is juſtified by faith, without the works of the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſince the Primitive times, we ſee what Doctrine has been found out by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that good works do juſtifie a man in the ſight of God, and Chriſt has merited this; that <hi>opera renatorum, good works after converſion,</hi> ſhall be the matter of their righteouſneſs, and Chriſt will ſupply what is wanting. And hence it's taught, <hi>That they may fulfill the Law, nay, do more than the Law requires in works of Supererogation, &amp;c.</hi> And others turn Faith into a work, and ſay, <hi>That it's faith that's accepted of God as the matter of our righteouſneſs, inſtead of the righteouſneſs of the Moral law, and not the righteouſneſs of Chriſt made ours by imputation.</hi> And he that ſhall obſerve what confidence men do place in their works, how they labour for life, and reſt in the duty done, and expect acceptance for it; and how they boaſt themſelves of their own performances, and how far moſt men are after a duty from a humble looking up to Chriſt for acceptance of it, as if they had done nothing, (for a man ſhould indeed work as if he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be accepted for his works, and yet reſt as perfectly in Chriſt for acceptation as if he had done nothing) he ſhall ſee that it is a diſpoſition that is deeply rooted in men to expect juſtification by their works.</p>
                  <p n="2">§. 2. But here it may be men will wonder that time ſhould be ſpent amongſt us in beating men out of this being under the firſt Covenant, and getting life upon impoſſible terms, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake perfectly to keep the Law, and to ſeek juſtification by works, ſeeing we are neither <hi>Jews</hi> nor <hi>Papiſts:</hi> We know we cannot fulfill the Law, but that there is iniquity in our holy things, and we are ſo far from reſting in our duties, that we acknowledge our righteouſneſs is as filthy rags; that if God ſhould look upon them as they are, he muſt needs abhor them and us for them: and therefore ſurely there are none amongſt us that do ſo; all this labour might be ſpared, for we are ſo far from deſiring it, that we diſclaim it and abhor it. But I anſwer to this, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> that a man ought to read in other mens practices his own inclination; this was a deſire in <hi>Adam,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.49.</note> and in his Poſterity, who do all bear the image of the earthly; for as face anſwers to face in the water, ſo ſin is alike in all men: and that man perfectly likes an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſinning in others that does not reflect upon himſelf, and ſee that there are ſeeds of it in him, that doth not read his own nature in another mans life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If there be the ſeeds of it in thy own heart, then though it never ſhould break forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to act, yet there is juſt cauſe that God ſhould loath thee for it, as we do Toads though they hurt us not. And indeed the main part of our enmity againſt God, and Gods againſt us, lies in the contrariety of our nature to him;<note place="margin">Col. 1.21.</note> we are naturally enemies to God in our minds; and this is the top of all a godly mans humiliation, this is but a part of all that evil treaſure that is within,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.7.</note> and there is more in the Ware-houſe than in the Shop. And that Chriſtian is never kindly humbled for any ſin if his humiliation ends in the ſin it ſelf, and aſcend not to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that is within him, that raging ſea that always is caſting out mire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We know that in the Saints there is no luſt perfectly mortified in this life,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.6.</note> for ſin dies a crucified death, and therefore though in a Saint it be ſtill upon the Croſs, and dying daily, yet it ſhall never be perfectly deſtroyed till this corruptible ſhall put on incorruption.</p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:52030:27"/>
                  <p>The Saints have the ſeeds of this ſin, of truſting in themſelves, in them alſo, and this luſt will not lye idle in them, the fleſh will luſt againſt the ſpirit;<note place="margin">Gal. 5.17.</note> and it ſhews how prone the nature of man is to it, and the actings of it, becauſe it has ſhewed it ſelf ſo in all ages. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one being asked why <hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> did ſpring up in all ages? anſwered, Becauſe there were <hi>Pelagianae fibrae</hi> in the hearts of all men: So if this be asked you, Why this luſt of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal confidence always breaks forth into ſinful acts? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you may alſo anſwer, There are <hi>fibrae</hi> of it in the heart of all men. Therefore if God have kept this luſt from acting in thee ſo much as it has done in others, O be thankful for ſo great a mercy; but be careful that thou ſay not, that it is not in thee, becauſe God has reſtrained the luſt from acting, for then it may be juſt with God to give a man over to the power of it, and he ſhall ſee by experience that it's a mercy to have it reſtrained, ſeeing he cannot be wholly freed from it in this life. It's a great evil when God preſerves men from ſin, for them to think there is no ſuch danger in it. Take heed leſt God let out ſuch a luſt upon thee, that will make thee a mourner all thy days: and remember how preſumptuous <hi>Peter</hi> was againſt his denial of Chriſt, yet how ſoon he was guilty of it. And how apt are Chriſtians, for not prizing a preſervation from groſs ſins, to walk fearleſly, and then God often leaves them to the power of luſt, and ſhews them the mercy of his former reſtraint. Indeed all luſts in the heart of man do not act alike; ſome luſts do work directly, and preſs men to ſin, as that of Whoredom and Drunkenneſs, a man has diſtinct thoughts about them; but there are ſome that do work indirectly and in a ſecret way, to guide men in their practiſe, and yet never come into diſtinct thoughts, but work as principles that lye low, and a man acts in the power of them, and yet obſerve them not; as in a Watch, every one may obſerve the wheels that move, but every one does not obſerve the ſpring from whence their motion proceeds; as a Scholar that ſpeaks and writes <hi>Latin,</hi> he does not think of the rules of Grammar every ſentence he ſpeaks, and yet thoſe rules have an influence into every word, and his whole diſcourſe is framed after thoſe rules; ſo there are ſome ſins, as Atheiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a man it may be never ſays in actual thoughts that there is no God, and yet this principle ſways with a man, and is at the bottom of every ſin. And ſo it is with this ſin, it may not come into actual thoughts that there is Eternal life to be had by our works, and we will exclude the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; and yet it may have a very great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the man in his whole courſe, as being a fundamental and mother-ſin.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) So far as any man does deſire to eſtabliſh his own righteouſneſs, ſo far he deſires to be under a Covenant of Works for juſtification and life; but this is the diſpoſition of every man by nature, therefore every man by nature deſires to be under the firſt Covenant ſtill: this was the great fruit of it amongſt the Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. and the words are very ſignificant, <hi>Going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs: i. e.</hi> ſeeking or ſtudying for it, as ſtudents uſe to do.

And to this end, becauſe they could not riſe up to the ſpirituality of the Law, they did therefore bring down the Law, by their interpretation, unto their own obedience, and all was to make their own righteouſneſs available for juſtification.

It's a hard matter for a man to be a painful Preacher, a zealous profeſſor, a faithful Stateſman, or a man that has laid out himſelf for the publick any way, but his heart will ſwell with privy pride therein; yea, even though he do profeſs to deſpiſe, and to diſeſteem the praiſe of men.</p>
                  <p n="3">§. 3.

                  <p>The Scripture ſpeaks of mens actions and diſpoſitions many times interpretatively; not as they are in the intention of the ſinner, but as they are in truth, and in the interpretation of God.<note place="margin">Prov. 8. ult.</note> Men are ſaid to love death; all thoſe that hate wiſdom and deſpiſe Chriſt, and live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, love death. Now men will all ſay that they do hate death; but yet in Gods inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, they hating the only way and means to life, they do all of them love death. So we read in <hi>Ezech.</hi> 8.5. <hi>They did theſe abominations that I might go far from my ſanctuary.</hi> It was not their intention in ſo doing actually and <hi>formaliter,</hi> but <hi>interpretative</hi> it was, becauſe they had ſet up an image of jealouſie in the Sanctuary, which would provoke God to remove; and yet if they had been asked they would all have ſaid, they would by no means have the glory of the Lord to remove. So men do not actually deſire to be under the firſt Covenant; but yet ſo long as they reject the offers and the grace of the ſecond, ſo long in, Gods interpretation they do deſire to be under the Law ſtill; and their rejection of the better Covenant offered, argues they like and love that under which they are; and reject the righteouſneſs of God, which is the ſame which is called the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and the righteouſneſs of faith, as the Apoſtle ſays,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.9.</note>

And unto this righteouſneſs, men through the pride and unbelief of their ſpirits, and contrariety to the Goſpel, will not ſubmit, <hi>They have not ſubjected themſelves unto the righteouſneſs of God.</hi>

All a mans own righteouſneſs, either what a man has done before his converſion, as <hi>Paul,</hi> or what he can do after his converſion, may be ſo abuſed and relied upon as to derogate from the righteouſneſs of God; for when men are convinced of their ſins, and ſee that there is ſomething wanting to their Salvation, then they think they will do ſomething more; as the young man in the Goſpel, <hi>What ſhall I do to inherit eternal life?</hi> he had a confidence in what he had done, and fearing leſt that might fall ſhort there was ſomething more that he was willing for to do. When men are once convinced of their ſins they cannot look upon any thing that they have done that will ſatisfie; and their good deeds will not weigh down their bad: but then they ſay, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Wherewith ſhall I come before the Lord and bow my ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the high God? will he be pleaſed with thouſands of Rams? &amp;c.</hi> As if their after-obedience ſhould make amends for their former ſins. And ſo under Popery at this day many do faſt and macerate their bodies, watch and pray, and chaſtiſe themſelves by ſcourging, and going Pilgrimage; give away all their Goods to the poor, and betake themſelves unto a voluntary Poverty, ſhut themſelves up in a Monaſtery and Hermitage, and ſeclude themſelves from all the comforts of this life; yea, even Princes and Emperours lay down their Kingdoms, and caſt away their Crowns, and betake themſelves unto a private life; and all upon this ground, that theſe ſhall be <hi>opera ſatisfactoria, ſatisfactory works,</hi>

                        <hi>Luth.</hi> in Gal. 5.</note> and ſo expiatory for their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſins. And hence it is, that men convinced of their ſins labour as for life to ſatisfie God, and to quiet their Conſciences. And when men have wrought hard all their days with ſuch expectations as theſe, they are hardly brought off to come to Chriſt as ſtript naked of all, and to acknowledge that all their righteouſneſs is an abomination. And theſe are the mountains that are to be caſt down, the high imaginations and preſumptuous thoughts of themſelves, before they can come to Chriſt; and the caſting down of theſe is a preparing the way for the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When mens Conſciences are awakened and ſin revived by an almighty work of the Law, and the ſecond Covenant offered to them, then they ſay the news is too good to be true, there is no mercy for them whatever God intends to others; ſurely he can never think thoughts of peace to them; he will never take ſuch toads and ſerpents as they are into his boſom to have communion with him; <hi>and they ſay there is no hope.</hi> While men are in peace, and ſin lies ſleeping at the door, ſo long a mans ſelf-love and ſelf-flattery makes it eaſie to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume; and he ſays, <hi>It's a ſmall matter to believe, for God is merciful, and Chriſt died for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> And if there be but a few men that ſhall be ſaved, yet he doubts not but he ſhall be one of that number. But when once God diſcovers his ſin and awakens his Conſcience, then the man ſays, <hi>Though the greateſt part of mankind ſhould be ſaved, and if there were but one man in the world that ſhould be condemned, ſurely he ſhould be the man.</hi> If a man had come to <hi>Judas</hi> after his Conſcience was awakened on the ſight of his ſin, before he hanged himſelf, and told him, be not diſcouraged though thou haſt committed a great ſin, Chriſt is the Saviour of the world, and it is but believing in him and this ſin ſhall be pardoned, and thy ſoul ſaved: He would have anſwered you as <hi>Spira</hi> did, when they did exhort him to believe, <hi>That they were as good bid him to fulfill the whole Law, and bid him lay hold upon a ſtar in the firmament.</hi> For a man to ſee ſin to be an infinite evil, and God to be a provoked God ready to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and Hell open, and himſelf ready to drop into everlaſting deſtruction, and yet now for him to caſt himſelf into the arms of everlaſting mercy, and relie for his eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on the favour of an almighty and a ſin-revenging God, and ſay, <hi>If I periſh I periſh, I will reſt upon him, and truſt to his mercy, whether he ſave me or damn me:</hi> For a man by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive act to ſhut out all other hopes and ways, and confine his thoughts to free Grace alone, and to leave himſelf at the mercy of God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 10.14.</note> and at his foot-ſtool to be willing to be at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it's that which the unbelief and deſpair of a mans heart upon the apprehenſion of the guilt of ſin, will never be brought unto, without an act of Almighty power, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.19. Therefore we read in <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.5. to make way for Chriſt there be vallies to be filled as well as mountains to be levelled and laid low. Before men are humbled they are mountains, too high to ſubmit to this righteouſneſs; and being humbled, they become vallies, and are too low to riſe up and to imbrace the Grace that is offered by the Prince of the ſecond Covenant. Now ſo far as a man does not ſubmit to the righteouſneſs of God, ſo far he deſires to ſtand under the firſt Covenant ſtill.</p>
                  <p n="4">§. 4. In a man under the Covenant of Works there are two things: (1) An anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirit: (2) Suitable fruits. And if a man deſire both theſe, then we may conclude he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be under this Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They that under the Covenant of Works have an anſwerable ſpirit, a ſpirit that does always accompany this Covenant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>We have not received the ſpirit of bondage again to fear,</hi> &amp;c. Now this was the natural fruit of this Covenant;<note place="margin">Gal. 4.24.</note> for it has only gendered to bondage ſince the fall: unto <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency it was a Covenant not of bondage, but of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52030:29"/> but being broken all that come under it are children of the bond-woman, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that does accompany it is a ſpirit of bondage. For there is a twofold ſpirit that is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto the twofold Covenant, and with the change of a mans Covenant, there follows a change of a mans ſpirit, and never till then; now this ſpirit is a ſpirit of fear to witneſs guilt, a fear of Gods preſence and a fear of Gods judgments;<note place="margin">Amos 1.10. Heb. 2.15. Iſa. 33.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Fearfulneſs has ſurprized the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite;</hi> and as <hi>Cain</hi> ſays, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Every one that meets me will kill me.</hi> Now when men are acted by this ſpirit from day to day they are full of guilt and fear; and all this does not awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them to ſeek out for a remedy, and to cry out unto Chriſt from day to day for a ſpirit of adoption, the ſpirit of a child; in Gods account they are well pleaſed with it, and they deſire it. As a man that walks in the ways of ſin, and is acted by the ſpirit of the world, and groans not under it, but is willingly led captive by Satan at his will, he deſires to be acted by that ſpirit; ſo a man that walks under bondage from day to day, and ſees not his miſery, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be led by the ſpirit of bondage, which is the ſpirit of the firſt Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This ſpirit has ſuitable fruits. As the ſpirit of Adoption is a ſpirit of love and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt; ſo it's with men alſo that are acted by a ſpirit of bondage, that ſpirit has its fruits alſo, and they are commonly ſuch as theſe three.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) They that are under this Covenant do place their Religion in outward performances. There was a righteouſneſs that the Phariſees had, under which they reſted, and that was making clean the outſide of the cup and platter, as a whited wall, as a painted ſepulchre; and their Conſciences are ſatisfied with it, as it was in <hi>Paul, before the commandment came and ſin revived, he was as concerning the righteouſneſs of the Law blameleſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">(2) They do all their ſervices without a Mediator, they do not bring their ſacrifice to the Prieſt the Lord Chriſt; and they do not bring their Incenſe to be mixed with his odours, but they come in their own names, and offer ſervices unto God immediately without a Prieſt: and though they may talk of Chriſt, yet they come not to him for acceptance, and to have the iniquity of their holy things taken away; but if the duty be done they expect it ſhall be accepted.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) They do all <hi>with a legal ſpirit,</hi> performing it as a task, and are glad it is over. It is by the ſecond Covenant that the yoke of Chriſt is eaſie; it is otherwiſe ſuch a yoke that man cannot bear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6. <hi>Men ſerve not in the newneſs of the ſpirit, but in the oldneſs of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> To <hi>ſerve in the newneſs of the ſpirit,</hi> is to ſerve <hi>ſpiritu novo &amp; ſpontaneo, with a new free ſpirit;</hi> and therefore in the oldneſs of the letter, that is in a ſlaviſh and a ſervile manner; when a man only looks at the duty commanded without, as a task, as an act of obedience, but not as an act of faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. It is the ſecond Covenant that writes the Law in the heart, and makes the duties ſweet and pleaſant unto a man, by putting into a man an inward princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of love anſwerable unto the things that are required; putting into a man an inward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition anſwerable to the Law, that a man delights in the Law according to the inward man; and men living in the ſtrength of a legal ſpirit, contenting and pleaſing themſelves therein, this is a plain argument, that they are acted by the ſpirit of the firſt Covenant, and bring forth the fruits thereof, and their contentedneſs under it, ſhews that they deſire and love ſo to be.</p>

                  <p n="1">§. 1. BUt how can this be, that men knowing themſelves ſinners, and under the curſe of the Law; and that unto juſtification by the Law, a perfect obedience is required, which it is no more poſſible for them to yield than it is to ſtay the Sun in its courſe, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Earth out of its place; and therefore the life promiſed therein is unto man fallen, upon an impoſſible condition, becauſe all the imaginations of his heart are evil, and only evil continually, and in his life there dwells no good thing, and therefore it is ſaid to gender to bondage, and all that are under it are bondmen. The caſe ſtanding thus, <hi>How comes it to paſs that there ſhould be in the heart of man a continual deſire to be under this Covenant ſtill?</hi> The grounds of it are taken from a threefold principle that is in the heart of man: A principle (1) of Ignorance: (2) Of Enmity: (3) Of Pride.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>From a principle of Ignorance;</hi> and that (1) of the Law, and the nature of the firſt Covenant, and mens condition under it. (2) Of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and the Glory of the ſecond Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Ignorance of the Law,</hi> and mens ſtate under that Covenant. (1) Men are naturally ignorant of Gods intent in giving the Law, and therefore look upon it as a Covenant by which they ſhould attain righteouſneſs and life, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.20. Chriſt anſwers the young man
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52030:29"/> according to his own principles, <hi>Good Maſter,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what ſhall I do to inherit eternal life?</hi> Chriſt replys, <hi>Keep the Commandments.</hi> For he looked upon it as a way of obedience in which he ſhould attain Salvation. And ſo all men would work for life, and that is given as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the <hi>Galatians</hi> were ſo greatly bewitched by falſe teachers, and drawn away from the truth of the Goſpel to join ſomething of the Law with Chriſt in the matter of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe they did not know, wherefore the Law was given, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19, 20. They ſeeing a Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and a promiſe of free grace and of righteouſneſs, and life without works, an inheritance by promiſe; and 430 years after a Law given requiring works, and promiſing life upon perfect obedience thereof, they did not know how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, but that either God did repent of and revoke his former Covenant, or elſe they muſt be both joined together in the matter of Juſtification and life: now to anſwer this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle acquaints them with the end why God did give the Law, it was not to ſet it up as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant alone, that any man ſhould attain righteouſneſs and life thereby; for unto man a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it is impoſſible and inexorable, it can neither be obeyed nor endured: but he ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>it was not given as a Covenant,</hi> by which men ſhould attain life, as it was to <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of innocency: as if God did intend any man ſhould be ſaved thereby, neither was it publiſhed to make void the Covenant of Grace, <hi>but it was added, not by way of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition but ſubordination,</hi> that it might be as <hi>Hagar</hi> to <hi>Sarah;</hi> a handmaid to further the ends of the Goſpel, and to advance the grace of it, that it might be as the avenger of blood to the City of refuge, and make men look for the Law in the Ark Chriſt, <hi>(Who is the end of the law for juſtification,)</hi> and that it might be the perfect rule of the obedience of the Goſpel. This men being ignorant of they look upon the Law as a Covenant of works, and all that they do in obedience thereunto is to gain righteouſneſs and life.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) <hi>Men are naturally ignorant of the ſpiritual meaning of the Law,</hi> Rom. 7.9. <hi>I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live without the law once.</hi> Here the Apoſtle ſpeaks of a double ſtate in which he was: [1] In times paſt in the ſtate of unregeneracy, <hi>without the Law;</hi> not in the letter, for he was bred up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> and one that knew the Scripture from a child; but <hi>without the Law</hi> in the ſpiritual ſence of it, in its glory, power, latitude, ſpirituality, and holineſs; which are the wonders of the Law that men by nature have not eyes to ſee, which <hi>David</hi> prays for, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.18. and which unto men by nature are accounted ſtrange things. [2] But there is another ſtate, and that is when the Lord was merciful to <hi>Paul</hi> in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; <hi>The commandment came,</hi> i. e. <hi>in a lively, vigorous and ſpiritual manner,</hi> having a ſpirit of life accompanying it; whereas before it was but a <hi>dead letter,</hi> and it brought in ſuch a light as did diſcover the ſecret thoughts and intents of his heart, and laid the whole inward man open, even the inward parts of the ſoul. And whereas before he was alive in performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, able (as he conceived) to perform all the righteouſneſs of the Law without blemiſh, and therefore full of ſelf-juſtification, and conceits of his own righteouſneſs, and high expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Salvation. <hi>Now ſin revived,</hi> that is, in the guilt of it in his Conſcience; and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to ſee his own miſery and ſinfulneſs, and loſt condition, which before he thought was very good. Now he ſaw all his own righteouſneſs which before he ſo highly eſteemed, and ſo much ſet by, to be nothing but droſs and dung. And natural Conſcience looks upon obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law as conſiſting only in the outward act, and if that be performed, Conſcience is ſatisfied; if men pray and hear, they are not ſolicitous for the acceptance of their perſons before their ſervices can be accepted; nor for the light manner of performance, and the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their inward man towards God therein; which doth plainly ſhew, that though they underſtand the Law in the letter, and ſtick to it therein, yet they are not acquainted with the ſpirituality of the Law.</p>

Now men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form

Some may ſee the defilement of their nature and their miſery, becauſe of the image which they bear, but very few are apprehenſive of their miſery by reaſon of the <hi>Covenant of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage</hi> under which they ſtand.</p>

                        <hi>Luther</hi> de bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis operibus primi pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepti.</note> and therefore <hi>Luther</hi> gives this rule, <hi>Whatſoever a mans conſcience and faith toward God is, ſuch are his works, which flow from the ſame principle; but where there is nothing of faith the edge is wanting to good works, and the whole life erroneous, and all goodneſs as nothing.</hi> I ſay that good works are accepted, if faith, which gives a man an intereſt in Chriſt, and a change of a mans Covenant, goes before. We ſhould bring naked Chriſt and a naked ſoul ſtript of all things elſe together: we would have you take Chriſt for your husband, and duties for the ſervants of Chriſt. While faith is to deal with Chriſt in the buſineſs of Juſtification, and acceptative works ſhould be ſhut out, and there <hi>ſponſus cum ſponſa,</hi> faith and Chriſt alone; but if faith walk abroad in the world works muſt ſtand at the door and follow as the handmaid, and the neceſſary conſequents of faith. Now men hearing that duties are commanded by God, they are apt to conceive that they muſt be done, and being done ſhall be accepted though it be not according to the method of the Goſpel; and that when we ſpeak againſt reſting in them as duties of the firſt Covenant, we ſpeak againſt good works, whereas we would have them performed but by a man whoſe perſon is accepted, his Covenant changed, and that by the principles of the Goſpel, the faith of Chriſt in his heart, and alſo unto the ends of the Goſpel.</p>

                  <p n="1">(1) <hi>They ſee not the excellency of this righteouſneſs;</hi> that it perfectly anſwers the Law, and that by reaſon of the Union with the Godhead, and by this means it far exceeds the righteouſneſs of the Angels, and is far more glorious than ever we could have had if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood: that we ſhould be made the righteouſneſs of God in him, and that the matter of our righteouſneſs ſhould be the great things performed by him, ſuffered by him, imputed unto us, and we thereupon reputed by an act of ſoveraignty, righteous before God; this men do not ſee, and therefore they admire the righteouſneſs of a Creature ſo much, as <hi>Paul</hi> did his own righteouſneſs by the Law; but when he had but a glimpſe diſcovered to him of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, he does abhor his own righteouſneſs for ever, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9, 10. <hi>That I may be found in him not having mine own righteouſneſs, but the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith.</hi> There is the glory of the Lord to be ſeen in the glaſs of the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. which is by a ſpirit of revelation in the knowledge of him,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.17.</note> which till a man does ſee, his heart will never be inflamed with admiration of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and with an inſtinct after union with him; when God did let but a glimpſe of this into <hi>Luther,</hi> and he did but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. <hi>That the righteouſneſs of God is revealed from faith to faith,</hi> Oh how he admired it, and was raviſhed with it! having never underſtood that Scripture before.

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Men are ignorant of the glorious ſtate and condition of that ſoul that ſtands before God in the righteouſneſs of God, and who at the laſt day ſhall not be found in his own righteouſneſs.</hi> When the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw it, he counted all things droſs and dung for it: and I doubt not but if the glorious Angels in Heaven had it revealed unto them, that it was the mind of God after they had ſtood ſo many thouſand years, that they ſhould abandon all their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and now lay hold upon a higher and more glorious righteouſneſs in his Son, they would ſpeedily do it, and caſt away all the ſervices that ever they have done, as preferring this righteouſneſs far above their own, and their condition therein above what it can be by their own righteouſneſs. For the righteouſneſs of an Angel, is but the righteouſneſs of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, though it be only the righteouſneſs wrought in his humane nature in obedience to the Law, yet it is that unto which the Godhead gave efficacy. The righteouſneſs of the Angels hath in it a poſſibility of being loſt: they are not by nature impeccable, though they are by grace; God does charge them not with <hi>actual folly</hi> indeed,<note place="margin">Job 4.18.</note> yet with <hi>poſſible folly:</hi> but Chriſt as Mediator is impeccable; (unleſs we can ſuppoſe God to ſin) the union between the natures being perſonal, <hi>&amp; actus eſt ſuppoſitorum,</hi> acts are of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: and therefore unleſs a poſſibility of ſinning ſhould befall the Godhead, the perſon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſin: and ſo it is righteouſneſs in an unchangable head, which could never be in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, neither was it in <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of innocency. And therefore bleſſed is the man whoſe <hi>unrighteouſneſs is forgiven.</hi> Now by the imputation of this righteouſneſs without works, he is put into a far more glorious condition than ever he ſhould have been by the firſt Covenant, if he had never ſinned. Believers having now a more glorious name, not only the ſervants of God, and the ſons of God, as the Angels are called; but the brethren of Chriſt, and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his fleſh and bone: a higher ſonſhip, not only ſons by creation, but by a myſtical uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, having a part in the ſonſhip of Chriſt, he gives them the priviledge to be called ſons of God; a higher inheritance, made co-heirs with Chriſt, for it is ſaid, <hi>Enter into your Maſters joy.</hi>

                  <p n="2">§. 2.

In the ſecond Covenant God is glorified in a far higher way than in the firſt; for there are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er manifeſtations of God in the ſecond Covenant. Now glory is but the reflection of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and therefore the more glorious the manifeſtation, the more glorious muſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection be. God did manifeſt himſelf indeed in the firſt Covenant gloriouſly, and yet God has ſet forth a larger ſyſteme of himſelf in the ſecond, and put the Angels to ſtudy that, by beholding the marvelous glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt; therefore the Saints now glorifie God in a higher way than under the firſt Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) He had before manifeſted <hi>his wiſdom</hi> in giving the Creatures a being, and had raiſed out of nothing a glorious fabrick, every thing in its order, and made Man after his own Image; but when Man had loſt himſelf, and blotted out that Image, he brought himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the curſe; now there is great wiſdom in repairing: for if man ſhall be ſaved, then God muſt be ſatisfied; now to take away ſin, and let the ſinner live; to ſend the ſin to Hell, and the ſinner to Heaven; to find out ſuch a ſurety of infinite merit anſwerable unto ſins demerit, and to work many miracles at once by a perſonal union of the ſecond perſon with a created nature; that the Incomprehenſibe ſhould be comprehended, Eternity brought within the bounds of time; he that bears up all things ſhould himſelf be born; and the ancient of days become a child, and that ever the tongue of man ſhould ſay ſuch a word as <hi>God manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> it is ſuch an act of wiſdom as was never manifeſted before.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) <hi>Juſtice.</hi> He had ſhewed juſtice in the firſt Covenant by threatning a curſe upon the breach of it; and he had executed juſtice upon the Angels that fell, by caſting them to Hell immediately without hope of mercy; but when the Son ſhall take ſin upon him, but by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, as his ſervant, and by his own appointment, now he will not ſpare a Son, though he put up ſtrong crys; but being made ſin he muſt be made a curſe; and that he that in all our afflictions is afflicted, that God ſhould delight to bruiſe him, it is ſuch a manifeſtation of juſtice, as was never heard of under the firſt Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:52030:31"/>(3) <hi>Power.</hi> In making a World he had declared power, but this was but power over the Creature; but now here is power over himſelf to anſwer the pleas and the juſt demands of his own Attributes, <hi>Let the power of my Lord be great, pardon them, &amp;c.</hi> Numb. 14.17.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4) <hi>Love.</hi> To give our firſt Parents a being, and ſo glorious a Covenant, and all the Creatures for their uſe, to have dominion over them all, was great love from God; but here is a higher act of love, to give ſinners a Son: <hi>ſo God loved the world, that he did not ſpare his only begotten Son.</hi>

In the ſecond Covenant Juſtification is the higheſt act of Soveraignty, to count things that are not, as if they were; to account Chriſt a ſinner, and make him ſin; and to count the ſinner righteous by the righteouſneſs of another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And hence we may ſafely conclude, that under the ſecond Covenant we honour God more by a way of believing, than ever we could have done under the firſt Covenant by a way of doing, becauſe the glory that we give him therein, is a reflection of a higher manifeſtative glory than ever was ſhewed forth under the firſt Covenant. And yet there is a principle of enmity in man againſt all theſe Divine Attributes of God, which makes men deſire to be under the Law.</p>
                  <p n="3">§. 3. There is alſo in man a <hi>principle of pride.</hi> Man will not ſubmit to the righteouſneſs of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.3.</note> which is the higheſt exaltation of the Creature. There is ſo much pride in the heart of man, that it will not ſtoop to it, looks upon it as a ſubmiſſion below him. We read how full men are of ſelf-juſtification:<note place="margin">Luk. 10.29. &amp; 16.15.</note> they have a ſpiders houſe, <hi>Job.</hi> 8.15. and upon that they lean; made up of outward duties, and common graces. So they in <hi>Matthew</hi> plead at the laſt day, <hi>Lord, we have propheſied in thy name,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but whoſoever builds his hopes of Heaven upon any thing in himſelf, any thing beſides Chriſt, builds upon the ſand.</hi> And this they do, becauſe it is their own, and the beſt thing they have, the higheſt excellency in the man. It is not ſo hard to deny a mans ſelf in riches and honours, and learning, and any inward abilities that commend a man but to men; no man thinks that for his learning he ſhall be the more accepted of God; but we think righteouſneſs commends us unto God, and therefore men have a higher eſteem thereof, and greater hope grounded upon it, than upon any excellency that is in them beſides. And therefore ſurely for a man to come to Chriſt and deny himſelf in that, and give up all to him, and to be willing <hi>to ſuffer the loſs of all things, that be may win Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3.8. <hi>To ſell all to buy the pearl,</hi> and to do it with joy; as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> did ſet no higher a price upon his <hi>Athenian</hi> Learning than this, That he had ſomething of worth to part with for Chriſt, and eſteemed it nothing in compariſon of Chriſt; herein is the higheſt act of ſelf-denial: and that's the reaſon that of all men, <hi>civil men, and thoſe that have but a form of godlineſs, are with the greateſt difficulty converted,</hi> and Publicans and Harlots go into the Kingdom of God before them, becauſe they have ſomething of worth to lay down, which their hearts are hardly brought unto. And to ſee how corrupt nature through the policy of the Devil, holds up the pride of it in this particular, that if it were poſſible it might make the blood of Chriſt of none effect, and therefore they will not truſt perfectly in the Grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by Jeſus Chriſt; whence we ſee the ſeveral opinions of their own righteouſneſs in this particular, and how they have minced it; but yet ſtill ſo as they hold ſomething of ſelf; and the great exception that men have to keep them off from Chriſt, is the ſame that the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate had when <hi>Tyberius</hi> did propound Chriſt to be head of the Capitol amongſt their Gods, and that with an offer of his own ſuffrage, they all were againſt it, upon this ground, <hi>becauſe he will be God alone:</hi> See it in all thoſe Popiſh Tenents, which (as Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> has well obſerved) is a Religion directly founded upon corrupt nature. And (1) they ſay, that ſome ſins are not mortal, nor deſerve <hi>damnation</hi> in the ſtrictneſs of Divine Juſtice. (2) That the inclination of the heart to ſin, and all motions to ſin without conſent, are no ſins.

(2) In a ready and willing ſubjection thereunto, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.19. when men do yield themſelves ſervants to ſin: as it is in reſpect of acts of ſin, men pleaſe themſelves in them, and they cannot forſake them, they are the joy of their lives, their ſweet morſels which they hide under their tongues, and they keep them and will not forſake them; ſo alſo in reſpect of a ſtate of ſin, which they are in under their Covenant, as the ſervant that would not go free.<note place="margin">Exod. 21.5.</note> Now when it is ſo that men are content with the bondage of the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is offered to them, and they will not be delivered; this ſhews that they are perfectly under the bondage of ſin, that not only they are with pleaſure held under the acts of ſin, and caſt fire-brands, and ſay am I not in ſport; but they are held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſtate of ſin alſo, and will not accept deliverance, will not go free:</p>
                  <p n="2">2. See here alſo <hi>the folly of ſin and the ſinner,</hi> even the higheſt rank of men, civil men and formal profeſſors, temporary believers, that have oyl in their lamps and go forth to meet the Bridegroom, and yet the Holy Ghoſt ſays they are fooliſh Virgins, becauſe men do not judge of the danger of their eſtates by reaſon of their Covenant, but go on as the Ox to the ſlaughter; yea they cleave unto this Covenant, and ſee not the miſery that they are in under it: and though the great work of the Spirit of God is to convince a man of his eſtate of ſin in this, that he is under the firſt Covenant and out of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8. yet men go on and will not ſee it, and yet walk with a great deal of confidence in hope of an everlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>See here how Satan blinds the eyes of them that believe not,</hi> and how the Lord gives them up to blindneſs in judgment that live under the Goſpel: they have the offers of the ſecond Covenant made known to them, they are under the Law, and they do hear the Law, that they are by nature bond-men, and can from this mother expect no inheritance, but as bond-men to be caſt out of the houſe for ever, and yet they cleave unto this; and the more the glory of the ſecond Covenant is offered unto them, the more violently they do oppoſe it, becauſe it would ſpoil them of their own righteouſneſs, and ſubject them unto the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God. Thus we ſee it in the whole people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but eminently in the Phariſees;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52030:32"/> this Covenant they had choſen unto themſelves, and they did deſire to be under the Law, and they thought themſelves very much enriched with the righteouſneſs of the Law; ſo that Chriſt preaching the ſecond Covenant unto them, and the grace thereof, their deſire to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh their own righteouſneſs did raiſe up the malice and rage of their ſpirits unto ſuch a height, that they broke forth into the unpardonable ſin, even the great tranſgreſſion: and there is the ſame deviliſh principle in us all, if the Lord reſtrain us not, that in oppoſition to the grace of the Goſpel we ſhould oppoſe it even to the unpardonable ſin.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> §. 3. It is an Exhortation to ſeveral Duties, but ſpecially three.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Labour for a work of humiliation for this ſin, and to be rightly convinced of it; for ſurely the nature of man is deeply leavened with it. There is a double conviction of ſin: (1) Rational, when a mans reaſon is overcome by the Word, that a man cannot deny nor diſpute againſt the truth of it, and yet his heart is not affected with it.<note place="margin">Joh. 16.8.</note> (2) There is a ſpiritual Conviction when the Lord comes in with an irreſiſtible light, and diſcovers the ſin, and cauſeth the heart to own it and ſtoop to it, and be affected with it with ſhame and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; and this is that conviction of the ſoul that does lead unto converſion, whereas the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther many times doth and may lead unto condemnation. And this ſin will be ſet upon the ſoul with theſe Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) It is a ſin againſt the Goſpel, and the foundation of all the grace thereof: now this is an aggravation: <hi>If the word ſpoken by Angels were ſtedfaſt, &amp;c.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 2.2, 3.</note> 
                     <hi>How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?</hi> If it be ſo dangerous to break the firſt Covenant, what is it to deſpiſe the grace and offers of a ſecond!</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) It doth reject the grace of God the Father, who had the firſt hand in the ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; for he might have dealt with us as he dealt with the loſt Angels, he did not catch after them when falling.<note place="margin">Heb. 2.16.</note> Now for the Lord to give you a ſecond offer of grace when he let the Angels go, and you to deſpiſe this grace, and whereas God had multitude of thoughts concerning this Covenant, and the grace thereof, for you to make all theſe thoughts of God of none effect, by deſiring to eſtabliſh the firſt, and by rejecting the Grace of the ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, is a great tranſgreſſion.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) Hereby a man is very injurious to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Joh. 4.10.</note> who is the greateſt gift of God; and the main of the excellency of this gift lies in this, that he is given as a ſecond <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> as a Mediator of the Covenant, the ſurety of the Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22.<note place="margin">Iſa. 42.6. Heb. 8.6:</note> the Angel of the Covenant, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6. by whoſe blood the Covenant is ſealed and confirmed, and therefore called the blood of the Covenant; now to deſpiſe all this is to trample under foot the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and the higheſt honour of the Son of God: for a man to bear old <hi>Adam</hi>'s image ſtill, ſhews that he prefers the Image of the firſt before that of the ſecond <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo for a man to ſtand under <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant ſtill, ſhews that he deſpiſes the Grace of the ſecond Covenant in compariſon of the Glory of the firſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4) It is a ſin againſt the Covenant it ſelf, and all the Promiſes thereof; this Covenant God has highly honoured with a more glorious head, and the righteouſneſs of it is a more glorious righteouſneſs, the promiſes of it better promiſes, and the ſtability of it far beyond that of the firſt Covenant; for it is an ordered and an everlaſting Covenant, a Covenant confirmed by an Oath: now for a man to bring down that Covenant that God has exalted, and in a mans heart and practice, and ways, for him to exalt the firſt Covenant above it, is the greateſt injury thereunto that can be.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5) It is a ſin againſt all the happineſs and hopes of the godly; for all their comfort comes in from this Covenant, as they look upon all their curſes to proceed from the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Though my houſe be not ſo with God,</hi> ſays <hi>David, yet God has made with me an everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all things and ſure, and this is all my hope.</hi> Now it is a great evil that men ſhould not be affected with that ſin which is againſt the generation of Gods children, againſt the hope of Iſrael. A man ſhould be deeply humbled and bewail this contrariety of ſpirit that is in him to the way of the Goſpel, and to the grace of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. And apply the righteouſneſs of Chriſt for the pardon of this ſin alſo; for as his blood was ſhed for them that ſhed it, ſo there is grace in the ſecond Covenant for them that have deſpiſed it, and have to their utmoſt exalted the firſt Covenant above it; and there is in the grace of God pardon to be found for them that reject or endeavour to fruſtrate the grace of it; <hi>For if righteouſneſs be by the Law, Chriſt is dead in vain,</hi> Gal. 2. ult.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whereever the Covenant of Grace is preached, be jealous and watch over thy own heart, becauſe there is in thee a principle of contrariety unto it, and the grace offered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: this hath been the manner of Gods people when they have been apprehenſive of evils in them, it has made them the more watchful againſt them. <hi>Job</hi> will not truſt his eyes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Covenant, nor <hi>David</hi> his tongue without a bridle, becauſe they knew how ſuddenly corruption would break forth; and therefore the exhortation is, Keep thy heart above all
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52030:33"/> keepings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God has offered the righteouſneſs of his Son, that thou mighteſt be made the righteouſneſs of God in him, and he has given his Son as a Covenant to the Nations; <hi>that as by one man ſin and death reigned, ſo righteouſneſs and life ſhould reign by one Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> but thou haſt a principle of pride in thee, and thou doſt deſire to eſtabliſh thy own righteouſneſs, and thou wouldeſt not ſubmit to the righteouſneſs of God; he is offered, but thou wilt none of him. Whenſoever the ſecond Covenant is preacht take heed of this root of bitterneſs, that it do not riſe up and cauſe thee to reject Grace and forſake thy own mercy: truly whoſoever does read how quiet this luſt was in the Phariſees, and they went on as a river runs ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without a damm, and they wrought for life, and by their own obedience they did as with rattles ſtill their Conſciences; but as ſoon as Chriſt came and preacht the righteouſneſs and grace of the ſecond Covenant to them, how did this luſt riſe in them, even to the rejecting the Counſel and Grace of God againſt themſelves, and even riſing up unto the unpardonable ſin? and ſo the Papiſts before <hi>Luther</hi> found out the righteouſneſs of Faith by an imputed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, they were all quiet; but afterward this one man, <hi>odium &amp; impetum totius orbis ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinuit.</hi> And this is the Doctrine preached by the Angel that did fly in the middle of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with the Everlaſting Goſpel,<note place="margin">Rev. 19.7, 8.</note> and declare then great <hi>Babylon</hi> begins to fall.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Be never ſatisfied till thou find in thy ſoul the contrary grace, and that is a deſire of being tranſlated, that thou maiſt be under the firſt Covenant no more; conſider there will come a day ſhortly, wherein God will judge the world in righteouſneſs, and he will judge every man according to the terms under which he ſtands. Now if thou be found under the firſt Covenant thou art found in thy own righteouſneſs; the Law genders to bondage, it works nothing but wrath, it ſpeaks nothing but curſe, and <hi>in this Court thou wilt ſurely be caſt;</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the ſecond Covenant there is a Chancery, a Court of mercy and grace, and there is yet a City of refuge to be found before thou beeſt dragged to the Lords Tribunal; go there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and fly unto the Lords ſanctuary, go now and acknowledg thou haſt ſtood out long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that grace that muſt ſave thee if ever thou beeſt ſaved, and that thou haſt deſpiſed that Covenant under which if thou ſtand not thou art everlaſtingly undone; and tell the Lord, thou canſt as well caſt off <hi>Adam</hi>'s image as tranſlate thy ſelf out of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant; tell the Lord who only has made the new Covenant, ſo he only can plant ſouls into it; for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Husbandman, and he has undertaken to tranſplant ſouls out of the old ſtock and bring them into the bond of the Covenant.<note place="margin">Ezek. 20.27.</note> Therefore I beſeech you, Brethren, by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, by the blood of the Covenant, by the coming of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and our gathering together unto him, that you ſeek a Tranſlation, and content not your ſelves to ſtand under the firſt Covenant, and do this whilſt it is called to day, while the offers of the Covenant of Grace laſt, before the <hi>Portcullis</hi> be let down, the black Flag hung out, the talent of lead laid, the irrevocable decree of God gone forth to ſeal up the meaſure of your iniquity, and ſhut thee up under the Law and the curſe of it for ever. God will not have the Grace of the Covenant, nor his Son the Prince of the Covenant, nor the Blood of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, always deſpiſed and rejected by obdurate ſinners; it ſhall not always ſtand at the door as if the Lord needed entrance and admittance; and if once God take away this offer of the Grace of the ſecond Covenant, and diſmiſs thee unto the bar of the Law, thou art certainly condemned and curſed for ever: for not believing in Chriſt, does not only bring thee under wrath, but leave thee under it, thou rejecting the remedy which is the Grace of the Goſpel, and thou art then eternally undone; for then from the condemnation of the Law and the ſentence of it there is no appeal or redemption.</p>

                  <p n="1">§. 1. WE have ſeen that to be under the firſt Covenant, though broken, is unto every man in a ſtate of nature a deſirable thing; though formally indeed men deſire it not, for they will all diſclaim it, but <hi>interpretatively</hi> and by conſequence they do deſire it, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. ult. it was <hi>finis operis,</hi> though not <hi>operantis; it was the end of the work,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 8.3.</note> 
                     <hi>though not of the worker:</hi> and ſo men going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, and not ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto the righteouſneſs of God, and being contented to be acted by a ſpirit of bondage, which is the ſpirit of the firſt Covenant, which doth produce in them fruits anſwerable to the Covenant under which they ſtand; this is in Gods account and in the cenſure of the Scripture, an argument of an inward deſire and contentment to be under this Covenant ſtill.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe men do look upon it as a deſirable condition, let us examine what this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, of a man fallen to be under the firſt Covenant as broken. Divines do commonly ſay, that a man that is in Chriſt is freed from the Law, he being dead to the Law, and the Law being dead unto him, in ſome reſpects as was mentioned at firſt. (1) For <hi>Irritation,</hi> the Law hath not this power in men to irritate and exaſperate, and enrage their luſts by the reſtraint and the prohibitions of them, and ſo they apply that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over you, for you are not under the Law.</hi> That is, ſaith <hi>Beza,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He exhorts them to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, <hi>Let not ſin raign in your mortal bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> and he does promiſe them ſin ſhall not raign.</note> under the Law only forbidding ſinning, and thereby provoking and increaſing luſt, but you are under Grace ſtrengthning againſt ſin, and healing it; and hence it is concluded from ſeveral other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that a man in Chriſt and under Grace, is freed from the Law, and irritation of it. (2) For <hi>Co-action,</hi> to keep them from ſin by force, for fear ſimply of the curſe of the Law, and to compell them to duty as a task-maſter againſt their wills when the Law they hate, and the duty that is required of them that they hate; and wiſh there were no Law, and look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as a yoak and a burden inſupportable: for as a godly man ſays of ſin, ſo a wicked man ſays of duty, <hi>that which I hate that do I.</hi> And it requires of him perfect obedience; as a task-maſter he muſt work brick, but gives no ſtraw; requires the full tale of duty, but gives no ſtrength nor aſſiſtance. The Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.8. <hi>if you be led by the ſpirit you are not under the Law:</hi> the ſpirit that is in you is the ſpirit of the ſecond Covenant, a ſpirit of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, a ſpirit of liberty, a free and a Princely ſpirit, which enables you to perform duties out of an inward principle of love to them, and delight in them; unto them the yoak is eaſie, and the burden is light; for it's their happineſs and honour, and meat and drink, to do the will of their Heavenly father. And ſo that place I conceive is to be underſtood, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>The Law was not made for a righteous man:</hi> that is, neither in the reſtraining act of it, or keeping from ſin only for fear of the curſe; becauſe he has an inward principle that luſts againſt it, and as a fountain caſts out the mud, an inward antipathy, a ſpirit luſting and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing againſt it; that though there were no curſe, yet he would hate it, and endeavour to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it; nor in the conſtraining power of it to force to duty only, as that which his ſoul hates, and he comes hardly off too in any meaſure to do that which is required, but he has a ſpirit within, the Law written in his heart, an inward principle ſuitable to what the Law requires of him; as it is ſaid of Chriſt in reſpect of that great Commandment was laid on him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18, <hi>This Commandment have I received of my father;</hi> for of that I think he ſpeaks, <hi>lo I come to do thy will, thy law is in the middle of my bowels; I have power to lay it down, and to take it up again.</hi> He had an inward principle that made him ready and willing, and chearful in it, and in this reſpect the Law was never made for them as the only principle upon which they ſhould act.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) For condemnation ſo as to be able to lay upon a man the guilt of his own ſin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52030:34" rendition="simple:additions"/> him for it; for the ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the Law: there is a deſtroying power in ſin, and this it has from the condemning power of the Law; do but take away the condemning power of the Law, and the ſting of death, that is, that power that it has to deſtroy the ſoul, is gone; becauſe the guilt is taken off the ſinner. Now <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13, <hi>He has delivered us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us.</hi> And ſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.23, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch there is no Law.</hi> It is not ſpoken againſt ſuch works, but againſt ſuch perſons; there is no Law, partly becauſe the Law is againſt none but thoſe that tranſgreſs it, and partly becauſe thoſe being the fruits of the ſpirit, do argue and clear to a man, that his Covenant is changed, becauſe he is acted by the ſpirit of the ſecond Covenant, and therefore he may thereby receive an evidence to himſelf that the condemning power of the Law is not againſt him any more.</p>
                  <p n="4">

                  </p>
                  <p>And from hence I argue, that if they that are in Chriſt and under the ſecond Covenant, are freed from the Law in all theſe reſpects, then all thoſe that are out of Chriſt, are under the Law ſtill in all thoſe reſpects; and therefore every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man is under the Law as a Covenant of works, and under this Covenant he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be: now the Covenant being broken, he is under it for <hi>Juſtification, Irritation, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action</hi> and <hi>Condemnation;</hi>

In being freed thus from the Law the main part of a Chriſtians liberty conſiſts; yet there is this difference, the two laſt refer unto a perſon and ſtate, and in thoſe his liberty is perfect, and he is wholly freed from the Law in point of Juſtification and Condemnation; but in the two former as to Irritation and Coaction it is but liberty begun, becauſe ſin in us is not perfectly deſtroyed; therefore ſo far as there are remainders of ſin in the Saints,<note place="margin">See Pareus in Rom. 7.5.</note> they are lyable to an Irritation, and a Coaction; but yet in a far different manner from that which is in unregenerate men, as will be ſhewed afterwards.</p>
                  <p n="2">§. 2. The Apoſtle having in the former Chapter ſpoken how ſin entered into the world, and death by ſin, and how righteouſneſs and life entred by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that as ſin reigned unto death, ſo grace ſhould reign through righteouſneſs unto life eternal; and ſhewing the fruits of this righteouſneſs killing ſin in us, Therefore we are dead to ſin, and the old man is crucified, and the body of ſin is deſtroyed, that we ſhould not henceforth ſerve ſin, for he that is dead is freed from ſin: for ſin is a Lord, and ſo long as the ſervant lives he is in ſubjection to his maſter, but the ſervant being once dead is free from his maſter: it's a ſpeech taken from all civil ſubjection, which began with ſin, and ends with death. Now ſin is compared to a Maſter or a Lord, to which a man is bound while he lives; but being dead he is freed from the power and dominion of ſin,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.11, 12.</note> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11, 12, <hi>Therefore count your ſelves dead unto ſin, and let not ſin reign in your mortal bodies any more.</hi> Ver. 14, <hi>For ſin ſhall not have dominion over you; for you are not under the Law but under Grace.</hi> Not under the Law as a Covenant, and ſo irritating ſin and exaſperating it, but under Grace, that is ſubduing ſin and hell. Some refer theſe words to the dominion of ſin, and a mans freedom from that, and ſome to the dominion of the Law, and a mans deliverance from it as a Covenant; but the main current of Interpreters make the Law the husband and the ſtrength of ſin to be by the Law unto condemnation and unto irritation; as the Law does occaſionally inflame the heart to evil, and luſt is enraged thereby: and they ſay the Law is dead unto us as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; it is a bond cancelled and taken out of the way, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14. and ſo we are dead to the Law by the body of Chriſt; that is, Chriſt as our ſurety, having paid our debt, ſatisfied the Law, and received the diſcharge, we are dead to the Law, it has no more power to charge ſin upon us,<note place="margin">See Ambroſ. to Jerom. alſo, &amp; Eſtius. Calvin. Par. &amp;c.</note> nor to ſtir up ſin within us: they make the Law to be the husband, the Soul the wife, and the children to be the fruits of Sin; which through the irritating power of the Law, it does bring forth in us, even all manner of concupiſcence. But other Interpreters, as <hi>Beza, Gomar,</hi> and ſome others, conceive that the husband is Sin, the wife is every natural man that is in the fleſh, and the fruits are all ſinful words, and actions that do proceed from ſin, which are fruits unto death; as the other husband is Chriſt, the wife a Believing ſoul, and the fruits all the fruits of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, which are called fruits unto God: and therefore ſome have put them both together; and ſo <hi>Reinolds</hi> in one place he calls Sin the husband,<note place="margin">Pſal. 130. &amp; the uſe of the Law, p. 368.</note> and in another place the Law the husband: and the difference is not much, whether we underſtand it of ſin, which takes occaſion by the Law, or of the Law as it does inflame and irritate ſin; for both of them may be truly ſaid to be dead unto the Saints, and they dead unto them; though it ſeems by the enſuing Objections moſt probable that the Law is the husband.</p>
                  <p>Now the Apoſtle comes to anſwer a double Objection, which ariſeth hence; For if ſin take
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52030:34"/> occaſion by the Commandment, and if it have a pollutive power by the Law; and as he ſaith Verſe the fifth, <hi>The motions of ſin, which were by the Law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit to death:</hi> then it ſeems there is a double evil that flows from the Law, ſin and death; for by the Law the motions of ſin work, and by the Law men bring forth fruit unto death. The words are an anſwer unto the firſt objection, which lyes thus: That which doth increaſe ſin, and ſin works by it, that is in it ſelf ſinful; but the Law doth increaſe ſin, and ſin works by the Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtle anſwers it two ways: (1) By Negation; it doth not follow, though the Law doth increaſe ſin, and ſin works by the Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the Law is therefore ſinful. <hi>Abſit, God forbid;</hi> it is an abominable inference; for the <hi>Law is holy, and juſt, and good,</hi> and a beam of that infinite Holineſs that is in God, and by which Gods Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs does ſhine forth upon us, therefore the Law is not ſinful: for that which only does diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſin is not ſin, but it is the Law only that doth diſcover and forbid ſin; therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (2) By a Tranſlation of the guilt, laying the blame upon corrupt nature, and the ſinfulneſs thereof, which the Law doth forbid and diſcover; (for the Law entered that ſin might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound) and therefore of it ſelf gives not occaſion to ſin. Yet ſin took occaſion when none was given, and did draw evil from that which is good in it ſelf, and ſuckt poyſon from that which is holy. For the Law is holy as well when it does by accident enrage ſin, as when by it ſelf it diſcovers it.</p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>Every man out of Chriſt is under a Covenant of works, and under the irritating power of the Law.</hi> The Law forbidding ſin and diſcovering ſin in him, has no other fruits but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage it, and increaſe it: as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſays, <hi>the flame of luſt is increaſed thereby:</hi> for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the law ſin is dead; that is, <hi>ratione cognitionis,</hi> it lyes dead, man knows it not to be ſin; and <hi>comparativè, ratione irritationis,</hi> in <hi>point of irritation.</hi> But the more clearly the law is diſcovered, the more bitterly and violently does corruption work againſt it. Whiles the law doth not come in a clear and convincing manner, ſin is quiet, and a man does not ſin with ſo much rage and violence againſt the law, as he does after the diſcoveries thereof. <hi>Sin was dead:</hi> that is, it did not put forth its utmoſt power to draw forth all manner of effects, till the law came, and by this means ſin is made <hi>exceeding ſinful;</hi> (as it is rendered by <hi>Eraſmus</hi>) ſin is not only diſcovered, but improved, and ſo it is made exceeding ſinful. So that the fruits of the law to a man under the firſt Covenant is this, <hi>Sin takes occcaſion by the Commandment,</hi> it does ripen his ſins, and improve them, and it draws forth in him all manner of uncleanneſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56, <hi>The ſtrength of ſin is the law.</hi> There is a threefold power ſin has from the law: (1) Of <hi>condemnation;</hi> and ſo the law, ſaith <hi>Luther, that is weak through the fleſh for juſtification, is through the fleſh powerful to condemnation.</hi> The law does ſtrengthen ſin by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning power. (2) Of <hi>Conviction;</hi> for the diſcovery of ſin is by the law, and it's through the law only that ſin does trouble the Conſcience and convince the ſinner. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I was alive without the law once: i. e.</hi> in his unregenerate eſtate; but his ſins were before alive only, they lay hid as colours in the dark. Now when the Commandment came ſin did appear to be ſin, it being diſcovered thereby: ſo that the ſtrength of ſin as to Conviction is by the law. (3) As to <hi>Irritation.</hi> By the law luſt is drawn forth and improved, and provoked, and ſo ſin receives a power from the law alſo: and therefore they that have the cleareſt diſcoveries of the law, their ſins are improved and made ſtronger than other mens; as it appears by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Zech. 5.6, 8. there was an <hi>Ephah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zech. 5.6, 8.</note> which is the greateſt dry meaſure amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> and it is <hi>wickedneſs</hi> that is in it, that ſets forth the fulneſs of their ſins; and we ſee what it was that did fill it up; ſin taking occaſion from the Commandment,<note place="margin">Jer. 1.11.</note> 
                     <hi>as a rod of an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond-tree their ſins did ripen in the greateſt colds;</hi> that which a man would have thought ſhould have been a means to have kept ſin under, that was a means to improve and increaſe it. As a basket of Summer-fruits, which is ſooner ripe than other fruits: <hi>Jer.</hi> 24.2.<note place="margin">Amos 8.1.</note> they were divided into two ſorts, the good figs very good, but the bad very bad, ſuch as could not be eaten: the rain does ripen the briers and thorns as well as the corn;<note place="margin">Heb. 6.7, 8.</note> therefore the law of God does improve mens ſins and ripen them, and haſten judgment for them.</p>

Though all ſins break not forth actually in every man, yet vertually and ſeminally all ſins are in every man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Luſts are acted and drawn forth by degrees, as water out of a fountain, it caſts not forth all at once; your experience teaches, that the more it is drawn, the quicker the ſpring is; no man is ſuddenly very bad, ſin ripens as a child in the womb; firſt <hi>luſt is conceived,</hi>

If he look upon the Sun in its brightneſs, his heart is enticed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He cannot look upon a <hi>woman but to luſt after her: they have eyes full of adultery.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.14.</note> (2) All opportunities draw out his corruption: as <hi>Gehazi</hi> ſaid, <hi>As the Lord liveth I will go after him, and get ſomething of him.</hi> And the Harlot, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. <hi>The good man is gone from home, &amp;c.</hi> (3) All eſtates do draw out his corruption: if in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity he does wax fat and kick, and as the paſture ſo is his filling, his heart is lifted up, and he forgets the Lord; and if afflicted with <hi>Ahaz,</hi> he ſins yet more: ſo that ſin takes occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by all the ways and diſpenſations of God towards the man; and as ſin is improved, and takes all occaſion by all other things, ſo it does by the law of God alſo, and ſo as a godly man grows from grace to grace, from faith to faith, ſo does a wicked man from ſin to ſin, from one degree of wickedneſs to another.</p>
                  <p n="3">§. 3. But the main thing in opening of the point is this: <hi>How ſin takes occaſion by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and what improvement the law that forbids ſin, and diſcovers ſin, can give unto it.</hi> There are ſeveral acts of the law by which ſin is improved.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note>1. The law as a glaſs doth diſcover ſins: <hi>I had not known luſt but by the law,</hi> ſays the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul.</hi> Now in this ſin takes occaſion by the Commandment three ways:</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) It does act many ſins becauſe they are forbidden; that there is nothing in the ſin that ſhould elſe carry the heart to it, but only we affect things forbidden. In ſins where there is neither pleaſure nor profit, yet how do the hearts of men run out to them, even to new oaths, and new-invented blaſphemies? as if they were the flowers of ſpeech, for which no man can give a reaſon but this, becauſe it is forbidden. As <hi>Hyperius</hi> gives advice unto Divines, not to revive ancient Hereſies in their reproofs, leſt thereby they do teach men thoſe errors they went about to refute. For the very hearing of a blaſphemy is enough to take the heart; as we ſee by experience daily, and the very ſpeaking of ſome things as ſins, is enough to draw out the luſts of men towards them. Thus ſin takes occaſion by the Commandment.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) The diſcovery of the Law makes ſin the more exceeding ſinful, becauſe it is againſt light, which ſhews it unto his Conſcience, and yet the man does it, and ſo ſin takes occaſion by the Commandment to become the more out of meaſure ſinful. [1] When the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment forbids, and diſcovers a thing to be evil, and ſin takes occaſion thereby to mince it, and in a politick manner to conceal it ſelf. Sin would do the thing, and yet elude the force and the ſpirituality of the Law, as the Phariſees; the Law ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſwear;</hi> but they ſaid, <hi>to ſwear by Heaven is lawful;</hi> and, <hi>it is lawful to ſwear by the Temple, but not by the Gold of the Temple.</hi> The Law ſaith, <hi>Men ſhould nouriſh their Parents;</hi> but they ſaid, <hi>it is Corban, a gift, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo the diſcovery of the Law makes a man to ſeek out curious ways of ſinning againſt it to avoid the power of the law: as we ſee in Gaming, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſin takes occaſion by the Commandment, that it may ſin more artificially; and ſuch men are hardly convinced. [2] The Law diſcovers ſin, and men will not ſee it, and ſo ſin takes occaſion by the Commandment, and vents it ſelf by refuſing knowledge: <hi>And they ſtop their ears that they may not be charmed by the voice of the charmer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 3.20.</note> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) Sin takes occaſion from hence, in that men hate the light of the law, and they wiſh that there were no ſuch law in the world. <hi>He that does evil hates the light, neither cometh he to the light leſt his deeds ſhould be made manifeſt and reproved.</hi> As the law diſcovers that to be evil in which the ſoul placeth its greateſt good, ſo this diſcovery draws out a hatred in the ſoul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt that law, which does as a glaſs diſcover the ſpots which the ſinner would have hidden.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The law does reſtrain ſin, and puts a ſtop, to it, and ſhuts up the ſinner, as we may read, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.23. Whence ſin breaks forth more violently; men being prone to ſin, and cannot live without it, (for the comfort of their life comes in by it.) The Law may reſtrain and keep in luſt for a while,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.43.</note> but it breaks forth as fire; when you ſuppreſs it outwardly, it burns the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter within, and ſpreads the more by a reſtraint. (1) It ſpreads the more in the man by the reſtraint of the Law: a man that hath forborn a ſin long, there comes ſeven worſe ſpirits at the laſt and makes him more the child of the Devil than he was before: the former reſtraint that was upon him, makes his inward man the more exceeding ſinful: As it was with <hi>Judas,</hi> a Devil though a Diſciple. The reſtraint of ſin by the Commandment cauſes it to defile his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52030:35" rendition="simple:additions"/> man the more. (2) The more ſin is enraged; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>They ſay, let us break their bonds and caſt their cords from us.</hi> Chains put not a fierceneſs into a beaſt, but yet it does outwardly draw forth that fury that was in its nature. As a potion in ſome diſeaſes given for the cure, irritates the peccant humour, and kills the man the ſooner; not that it puts a new ſickneſs in, but only the humours being ſtirred are the more enraged. (3) So in this caſe it does not only enrage ſin, and ſo make it more fierce, but it improves it by this enraging: as the preſence of an injury doth heighten a mans anger, as we ſee <hi>Goliah</hi> did <hi>David</hi> s; his brags drew forth <hi>David</hi>'s courage, and it roſe to the greater height: and ſo any difficulty would <hi>Alexander</hi>'s, ſo that it was an exploit fit for <hi>Alexander,</hi> if none elſe would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it: and ſo a damm in the water, it does cauſe it to ſwell and foam the more, and the coldneſs of the circumſtant air in the winter does not put more heat into the fire, and yet by an <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi> it excites it, ſo that it is felt the more. And therefore men living under the cleareſt diſcoveries of the Law, their ſins do riſe to the greateſt height: men by the light of nature cannot ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, the great and the unpardonable tranſgreſſion; but this ſin is by Goſpel-light, and this draws forth to direct enmity a mans ſpirit againſt the light, ſo that he ſins wilfully after that he hath received the knowledge of the truth, and with deſpight; for it is this being under the irritating power of the Law, that is the great occaſion of the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a condemning power of the Law, it paſſes a ſentence upon a man and upon his eſtate, and let's into his ſoul by the ſpirit of bondage fear of death, and dreadful apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of wrath, fearful expectations of judgment, and of violent fire to devour him. And from this alſo ſin takes occaſion, (1) By reaſon of terrours, that a man ſhould deſtroy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and become the inſtrument of his own mercy, and be his own executioner, as <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Achitophel,</hi> and many others have done. And (2) hence ſin takes occaſion to drive them to deſpair, and draws it forth, faſtning their eyes upon the vengeance of God, and never ſhewing them the remedy and the pardon; and then with <hi>Cain</hi> men ſay, <hi>mine iniquity is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than can be forgiven.</hi> (3) Hence follows a giving up themſelves unto all exceſs of riot; there is no hope, and therefore I will enjoy the good things that are preſent, and not have a Hell here and hereafter too. And therefore they refrain not from any evil way, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to take their fill of ſin while they are here; for they are ſure they can be but damned: as many a wicked wretch when he is condemned to die, he cares not what he does then, for he knows he can be but hanged: <hi>Let us eat and drink for to morrow we ſhall die.</hi> (4) The rage of their ſpirits does riſe from hence, even to blaſphemy and revenge againſt God. He ſaith, <hi>O that I were above God! for I know that he will not have mercy upon me.</hi> And ſo the Damned in Hell do blaſpheme God by way of revenge, becauſe they are ſhut up under wrath, and know that there is no mercy for them. And this is the ground alſo of the great rage and revenge againſt God, that is acted by the Devil ever ſince the fall. Thus men ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves condemned by the Law, and being in a continual expectation of this wrath, the revenge and rage of their ſpirits againſt God is by this means drawn forth, and in all theſe reſpects ſin does take occaſion by the Commandment, and becomes the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſinful.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. II.</hi> Whence it is that the Law exaſperates and encreaſes Sin.</head>
                  <p n="1">§. 1. LET us now come (having proved the Point) to look into the grounds of it, <hi>How it ſhould come to paſs that that which diſcovers ſin, and forbids it, ſhould exaſperate and increaſe it; and that that which is a means to lead the people of God into ways of holineſs, and to ſanctifie them, converting the ſoul, making wiſe the ſimple, ſhould occaſion ſin and death to others.</hi> We muſt lay this as a ground, <hi>That the cauſe is not in the Law:</hi> the Apoſtles care is to remove any blemiſh that may be caſt on the Law of God, as if God had given a Law to this end, to add unto the ſin of man; whereas indeed before the Law ſin was in the world, and it was out of meaſure ſinful; but it did not appear ſo without the Law. There is a twofold cauſe that the Apoſtle does here point us unto. (1) There is <hi>cauſa per ſe, a formal cauſe;</hi> which does of it ſelf and of its own nature properly produce the effect from ſome inward and intrinſecal power and efficiency, and ſo the Law is not the cauſe of ſin in a man, neither is there any thing in the Law that ſhould produce any ſuch effect, but rather the contrary; for it doth forbid ſin upon the higheſt penalties, it has upon it an impreſs of the Holineſs of God, and is contrary to ſin in all things, being holy and juſt, and good, and in its proper cauſality, does work holineſs in the hearts of men, and a conformity unto the will of God as the rule of Goodneſs, as it appears in the Saints; all the grace that they have
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52030:36"/> is nothing elſe but the Law written in their hearts, which is the grand promiſe of the new Covenant. (2) There is <hi>cauſa per accidens, an accidental cauſe;</hi> when the effect flows not from the nature of the cauſe, but from ſomething elſe that does by accident cleave to it; ſo the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>knowledge puffs up:</hi> all true knowledge is humbling, and there is nothing that a man can know either of God or himſelf, but it does afford him great ground of abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſelf-denial; but yet through the luſts of men ſin takes occaſion by the knowledge that ſhould humble him to lift him up: ſo fountains are hotteſt in the Winter, and the fire by reaſon of the cold of the circumſtant air; not that the Winter does add heat to either by its own nature, but by accident and occaſionally incloſe the one and draw forth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo the Goſpel meeting with the luſts of men, who either reject the Goſpel, or elſe do turn the grace of God into wantonneſs, thence it becomes <hi>the ſavour of death unto death;</hi> not of it ſelf, nor in its own nature, for it is the word of life and ſalvation: ſo does the Law draw forth ſin, not of its own nature, for it forbids it, and curſeth it; but yet ſin takes occaſion by the Law, and through many things that do adhere and cleave to the man by the Law, it does become the more exceeding ſinful.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore come unto the proper cauſes how it comes to paſs, that ſin by the Law, which is good, ſhould take ſuch an occaſion of evil. The cauſes are many.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>One cauſe of it is luſt.</hi> There are in luſt many things from whence it flows, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally theſe. (1) Luſt is carried towards its object with <hi>earneſtneſs, violence,</hi> and <hi>vehemency;</hi> there is a <hi>lifting up of the ſoul to vanity,</hi> and the <hi>hearts going after covetouſneſs;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome render that of <hi>Laban</hi> when <hi>Jacob</hi> departed, and he ſaw that the hope of his gain was gone,<note place="margin">Gen. 31.20. Deut. 29.19. Amos 2.7. Eph. 4.19. Jude 11.</note> 
                     <hi>that he ſtole away the heart of Laban.</hi> And as a godly mans deſires are for God and Grace, ſo a wicked mans deſires are after ſin, and he thirſts and pants after it; and it is therefore expreſt by greedineſs, as we may ſee it in <hi>Shechem, Amnon,</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> after <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both</hi>'s Vineyard. All theſe ſet forth the violence of luſt, how fully the ſoul of man is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after ſinful objects; and the ground is, becauſe ſin looks upon ſinful objects as the husband of the ſoul, as the chief good, and therefore is carried after them, <hi>modo infinito, in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite manner,</hi> as a God; therefore they are ſaid, <hi>to ſerve mammon;</hi> and <hi>their God is their belly;</hi> and <hi>they are lovers of pleaſures more than lovers of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> and therefore deſire them infinitely: the ſinner is never ſatisfied, but like the barren womb <hi>crys, give, give;</hi> his deſire is as <hi>Hell and the Grave,</hi> it never has enough. Now whatever comes in the way as a bar unto that which his ſoul does ſo infinitely deſire, it is no wonder if his heart riſe againſt it with an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable violence. If <hi>Naboth</hi> come in the way of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Covetouſneſs, his life is little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make ſatisfaction; and if any man ſtand in the way of <hi>Haman</hi>'s honour, his life and the life of a whole Nation is but a fit ſacrifice to expiate ſo great an offence. Now the Law of God putting a ſtop upon ſuch vaſt deſires, therefore the hearts of men do riſe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law, in oppoſition anſwerable to the deſire that ſin hath unto the object from which it is ſtopt by the prohibition of the Law.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) Luſts are <hi>proud,</hi> and <hi>do ſwell the heart, and cauſe it to be lifted up,</hi> Pſal. 10.4, <hi>The wicked through the pride of his countenance doth not ſeek after God.</hi> Obed. 3, <hi>The pride of thy heart has deceived thee.</hi> And this fills the heart with a great deal of obſtinacy and ſtoutneſs of ſpirit againſt God, and contempt and ſcorn of whatever comes in his way to reſiſt it; as we ſee in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> even againſt the Lord himſelf, <hi>Who is the Lord that I ſhould obey his voice?</hi> And anſwerable unto a mans pride and exaltation of ſpirit, ſuch is the riſing of his heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any thing that makes againſt him; and the more full of luſt any man is, the more the pride of his heart is drawn forth; for he is thereby made the more conformable to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, who ſaith, <hi>I am a God,</hi> and ſo do all mens luſts ſay; and therefore the heart is lifted up as a God, anſwerable to the pride of a man, ſuch is his impatience.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) Luſt is <hi>reſolute;</hi> this proceeds from the two former, it will go on whatever come of it,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.3. Hoſ. 9.</note> in deſpight of all oppoſition. There are <hi>wills of the fleſh,</hi> as great reſolutions as if there were many wills in one, as a <hi>wild aſs alone by it ſelf,</hi> i. e. that has neither rider to command it, nor bridle to reſtrain it, will venture any-where, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.7, <hi>They go on in their own ways as the horſe ruſhes into the battel.</hi> Chriſt warns <hi>Judas, The ſon of man goeth indeed, as it is written, but wo to him by whom the ſon of man is betrayed; it had been good for that man that he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been born:</hi> And yet <hi>Judas</hi> went forth, and from that time he ſought an opportunity to betray him. If the Lord make hedges about a ſoul, yet he will labour to tread down all with the greateſt reſolution, and with the higheſt contempt, as we may ſee it in <hi>Pharaoh</hi> after all his plagues, yet his heart was hardened, that is, his will remained obſtinate, and he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to yield unto God come what will come; yea though death to himſelf, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction upon his Kingdom did enſue.

                  <p n="4">(4) There is in every luſt a <hi>principle and root of enmity againſt God;</hi> for men naturally are haters of God, and enemies to God, and there is nothing but luſt makes them ſo:<note place="margin">Rom. 1.31. Col. 1.31.</note> Now as in every man there is all ſin vertually and ſeminally, ſo there is all ſin in every ſin, and there is in every ſin a principle of ſin that will produce all manner of iniquity, as we may ſee in the firſt tranſgreſſion; it was but one ſin and one act of ſin, yet there was in it all manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement that has filled the nature of man with all manner of pollution. The ſin of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils was but one, and that a ſpiritual ſin alſo, and it has filled the Devils with all that Deviliſh malignity, that has manifeſted it ſelf in them ever ſince. Now as there is in every ſin a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of enmity againſt God, ſo radically and ſeminally there is in every ſin the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt even the great tranſgreſſion;<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.13.</note> even ſecret ſins they do make way for this ſin againſt the Spirit of God, Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which is direct enmity againſt God, with deſpight and revenge; and it is oppoſition that above all things in the world draws it forth; and the more clear a mans light is, the more ſpiritual the oppoſition that is made againſt him is, the ſooner the man comes into the great tranſgreſſion. And theſe are the great grounds in luſts, which take occaſion from the Commandment; the violence of luſt the more it is oppoſed the more it deſires, and deſires by reſiſtance are kindled and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and from the pride of the heart it raiſeth oppoſition with the greater impatience and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, come what will come; and all this coming from a principle not only of collateral, but of direct enmity againſt God, it is with deſpight and revenge. In theſe ſin takes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the Commandment, and the oppoſition thereof improves it and draws it forth. As it is in grace, affliction improves it, and oppoſition draws it forth, temptations and deſertions confirm it, as there were many acts of grace in <hi>Job</hi> that had not been drawn forth but by affliction; ſo it is with many of the Saints, many men had never been ſo gracious but by oppoſition, as we ſee it in <hi>Luther</hi> and in many of the Martyrs, that their Graces roſe by their oppoſition and perſecution. So many men had never been ſo wicked, as we ſee it in the Phariſees, had they not lived under ſuch glorious means of Grace, and ſo clear Convictions which ſet bounds to their luſts, which made them break out with the greater rage: for Chriſt ſays to them, <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken to you, you had had no ſin, but now there is no cloak for your ſin:</hi> for by the oppoſition that their luſt met with it was drawn forth more impetuouſly.</p>
                  <p n="2">§. 2. There is yet a further ground of this irritating power of the Law, and that is from <hi>the curſe of God that is come upon all men under the fall,</hi> which came not only upon man but upon all things elſe for mans uſe; and ſo though it be the curſe of the Law, yet it comes even upon the Law it ſelf, (ſo far as it concerns man) as well as upon all the Creatures; yea the Lord Chriſt himſelf is ſo far a curſe unto men in their ſins, that as he is a ſanctuary to his people, ſo a <hi>ſtone of ſtumbling and a rock of offence, a gin and a ſnare unto others, for the fall and the riſing again of many in Iſrael,</hi> Luk. 2.34. <hi>For judgment,</hi> ſays he,<note place="margin">Iſa. 8.14.

                     <hi>I am come into this world;</hi> and yet he ſays in <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.47. <hi>I came not to judge and condemn the world but to ſave the world.</hi> This indeed was his intent primarily and <hi>per ſe,</hi> but the other falls out through the ſinfulneſs of men, <hi>occaſionally</hi> and by <hi>accident;</hi> and that which is good in it ſelf does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come evil unto the man, and that which is a bleſſing in it ſelf doth to him become a curſe: ſo it is with the Goſpel, and with all the ordinances thereof, 'tis the <hi>ſavour of life to ſome,</hi> but <hi>of death unto others;</hi> the ſame meat is wholſome nouriſhment unto ſome, to others, it feeds the diſeaſe in an unſound body; and the ſame light which is pleaſant unto a good and a ſound eye, is a pain and a trouble to a weak eye which is ſore or bloodſhot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it puts no malignant nor ſinful quality into the Law or Goſpel, or the Ordinances, but only theſe meeting with a man of an unſound ſpirit do occaſionally ſtir up theſe corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſinful diſpoſitions, which were in the men before, and thereby do increaſe them; and by this means it becomes a curſe to the man, though it be a bleſſing to the people of God. There is a double curſe that is come upon all things by the fall: (1) They are all of them <hi>empty</hi> and <hi>deceiving.</hi> (2) They are all of them <hi>corrupting</hi> and <hi>defiling,</hi> this is the curſe that is come upon all the Creatures.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52030:37"/> an empty word, and it does fall upon a man as rain upon the Wilderneſs, it has laboured in vain, as even Chriſt himſelf ſays, <hi>My work is with the Lord;</hi> but in vain to the people, for they received no good by it, but they <hi>have ſown the wind:</hi> it is ſpoken of all their religious ſervices,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 7.7.</note> they were empty and unprofitable, and would do them no good at the laſt day, bring them in no more harveſt than a man might expect that did ſow but the wind. And in <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> 'tis ſaid, <hi>They ſhall not profit this people at all;</hi> for there is a vanity in Ordinances as well as in Creatures, and the ſtaff of the bread of life may be taken away, even then when our bread it ſelf may continue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (2) They are <hi>polluting,</hi> for though all the Creatures can do a man no good, yet they can do him much hurt, and add to the defilement of his ſpirit, and draw out his ſins, and ripen them, and fill up his meaſure, they can ripen the briers and thorns;<note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note> and this was all the fruit that many of the <hi>Jews</hi> had by the Miniſtery of Chriſt: <hi>If he had not ſpoken to them they had had no ſin, but now they had no cloak for their ſin.

                     <note place="margin">Tit. 1.15.</note> And all thoſe things that are means of cleanſing to the Saints they are unto unregenerate men means of polluting.

                  <p>There are in the Law of God ſeveral Properties, and ſin takes occaſion from them all.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is a ſpiritual depth in it, that reaſon and all the natural abilities of a man cannot underſtand, as we ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14, <hi>The natural man perceiveth not the things of God.</hi> The word in the <hi>Greek</hi> ſignifies a man with all the abilities and poſſibilities of nature, however raiſed and improved; yet there is ſomething in the Law of God that it cannot attain unto: there is a literal rational part of the Law that men may know; but there is a ſpiritual part of it that they cannot know, and therefore <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.13, <hi>Seeing they ſee not:</hi> there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Law that they do ſee, and ſomething that they do not ſee; they cannot ſee that that is above the ſearch and the diſcovery of reaſon at the higheſt and beſt, and therefore the wiſeſt men in the world have been blind therein, ſo that we may ſay, <hi>where is the wiſe man, the ſcribe and the diſputer of this world?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.</note> Here is only place for Faith, the Law cannot be known but by a ſpirit of revelation, as <hi>David</hi> prays, <hi>Open thou mine eyes that I may behold wonders out of thy Law.</hi> Now from hence ſin takes occaſion by the Commandment, and it will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what it cannot comprehend. The <hi>Athenian</hi> Philoſophers laught at the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Doctors counted the <hi>preaching of the Croſs fooliſhneſs,</hi> that ever any man ſhould believe Salvation by a Crucified Saviour; and the <hi>Jews</hi> derided it in Chriſt, <hi>that he ſhould be the Saviour of others who could not ſave himſelf, &amp;c.</hi> And truly this has been the great reaſon of all the Hereſies that have been in the world, becauſe there <hi>is a wiſdom of the fleſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>that is not ſubject unto the law of God, neither can it be;</hi> that will undertake to try the deep myſteries of the Word, and to weigh them by her ballance, and ſo becauſe it cannot underſtand them it rejects them. This was the ground of all Hereſie from the beginning: and <hi>Luther</hi> ſays, <hi>Superbia mater omnium haereticorum, pride is the mother of all hereſies:</hi> and ſo <hi>Auguſtin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Page 20.</note> and <hi>Polycarp</hi> in his Epiſtle <hi>ad Philip.</hi> when he would deſcribe the Hereticks of thoſe firſt times, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>to methodiſe the Oracles of God according to mens pleaſure is the firſt-born of Satan.</hi> And this has been the occaſion taken by men to deny the Trinity of Perſons, and the Perſonal Union of Chriſt, the Godhead of the Holy Ghoſt, and of all the errors of the <hi>Socinians</hi> and the <hi>Arminians.</hi> And this has made Popery and all thoſe things take ſo with men, becauſe they are both agreeable to reaſon and to luſt; and Popery being a Doctrine ſo exactly fitted to corrupt reaſon, it did ſo eaſily overſpread the whole face of the world: but ſin takes occaſion from a profoundneſs and depth of things revealed in the Law, to deny them, and deride them as fooliſhneſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are not only above reaſon, and ſo rejected becauſe they are above it, but there is a plainneſs and ſimplicity in the Goſpel, and a great deal of ſeeming meanneſs and folly; and there is much in reaſon to be ſaid againſt it, and here men are offended, and they ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at it. For a man to forſake Father and Mother, and to hate them, yea, and his own life alſo, to lay down all when the Lord ſhall call for it, rather than to offend him, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour him in the leaſt; for a man to go ſell all that he has, that he may have treaſure in Heaven, there is much that reaſon has to ſay againſt this; a man looks at it as folly, and ſuch Doctrines he is offended at. And this is the true reaſon of all the human ornaments and blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhments
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52030:37"/> that men deſire in the diſpenſation of the Word, that there may be ſomething to take the fancy, while the Conſcience does evade the blow.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Law is <hi>hard to be underſtood,</hi> and therefore men put variety of interpretations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; and are ſaid to wreſt the word; they put falſe gloſſes upon it,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.16.</note> and in this the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men are drawn forth, and take occaſion to ſtand for them, being put to it, as the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees were, who did unlord the Law, and take away the ruling power of it, by putting a ſence upon it, that the Spirit of God never intended; and ſo by ſubtil <hi>diſtinctions</hi> and <hi>evaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> take away the ſpiritual part of the Law.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Law hath a <hi>difficulty</hi> and <hi>impoſſibility</hi> unto man faln, and at this men are offended, and ſay who can be ſaved; and they reject it as impoſſible, <hi>for the law is weak through the fleſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.25. Rom. 8.3.</note> 
                     <hi>and by the works of it can no man be juſtified in the ſight of God.</hi> Men object, God does require that of the Creature which it cannot perform, and how can this ſtand with the juſtice of God? The Law was not originally impoſſible, for man had an ability perfectly to obey it, but it is now become accidentally impoſſible; it is through the fleſh weak, and ſo Legally impoſſible, but Evangelically poſſible.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. From <hi>Satans working with the Law,</hi> and God giving a man over unto his power, and the efficacy of his deceit; to a blind mind and a hard heart, and a deſperate reſolution in a way of ſinning. There is a double deſign that the Devil has upon man; (1) He would conform him to himſelf and ſtamp upon him his own image; and therefore in all bodily luſts and acts of collateral enmity, his aim is to draw men unto direct enmity: thence he can be content to go out of men in many outward and groſs luſts, that he may draw them into ſpiritual wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs the more; and the more any man comes unto that, the more perfectly he is a Devil: Satans aim is even in all his temptations, of the Saints as well as wicked men, to touch them,<note place="margin">Jon. 6.7. Job 5.19.</note> and to leave in them an impreſſion and ſtamp of his own deviliſhneſs; and therefore the more men ſin againſt knowledg and with deſpight, and diſaffection unto God, the more he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with it: for as God loves holineſs in the ſpirituality of it, and the nearer a man comes unto conformity to God the more God delights in him; ſo Satan loves ſin in the ſpirituality of it, and the nearer a man comes in conformity unto Satan, the more ſpiritual his wickedneſs grows; and Satan delights to act that man of all other. (2) The dearer any thing is unto God the more Satan delights to abuſe it unto this end, and the more God hath ſet up any thing againſt ſin, the more Satan does endeavour to make that a means to draw men unto ſin: ſometimes he ſeeks to abuſe the Creatures of God, and ſtir up luſt by them, as when a man looks upon the Sun when it ſhines, and his heart is enticed thereby; ſometimes he looks upon a Woman and luſts after her; ſometimes he looks upon the Wine when its colour looks red in the glaſs; and thus the Creatures of God are abuſed by Satan to draw out the luſts of men; <hi>and whatever is in the world is the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the ey, and the pride of life,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.15, 16. Sometimes he abuſeth the ſervants of God, he will enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Peter</hi> and he ſhall become a tempter unto Chriſt, that he ſaith, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan:</hi> and the woman that God gave man to be a help, ſhe ſhall by Satan be made a dart; and ſometimes the Law and the Goſpel, which ſpecially God has ſet up as a remedy againſt ſin, ſhall act it and improve it, and draw it forth. Now God leaving a man under the power and dominion of Satan the God of this world, who works effectually in the children of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, he is as a conquerour over them, and triumphs in this, that he has made uſe of the Law of God, and the Goſpel of God, that is made againſt ſin, to increaſe and ripen it; yea, even the motions and common works of the Spirit of God, the heart of man riſing and making head againſt them, are the great means by which Satan draws men to the great tranſgreſsion, even to ſin againſt God with deſpight and revenge.</p>

And ſo, as other fruits of the curſe of the law are bleſſed and ſanctified unto them as their afflictions, their temptations, and death it ſelf; ſo ſhall theſe fruits of the curſe be alſo ſanctified unto them, and tend to their ſanctification, and end in the perfection of their holineſs at the laſt. So that as death is ſwallowed up in victory in a mans reſurrection, ſo is ſin alſo in a mans perfect ſanctification, unto which (through the Grace of the Goſpel) ſin it ſelf was over-ruled to be a means: for as there are two ways of a mans pollution, ſo there are alſo two means of a mans ſanctification; there are proper and natural means, as Satan and a mans own luſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and there are occaſional means, as the law of God; ſo there are of a mans ſanctification, the Word and the Spirit, and the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; and there are occaſions which in their own nature do work no ſuch thing, but Grace takes occaſion from the one, as corruption does from the other; the temptations of Satan and the improvement of ſin by the law being ſprinkled by the blood of Chriſt ſhall be as effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to a mans ſanctification, as the other being not ſprinkled with the blood of Chriſt ſhall be effectual to a mans pollution.</p>

There are two truths that ſhould be always in a mans eye, <hi>God to be the chiefeſt Good, and Sin to be the greateſt Evil.</hi> There is no one thing that does ſet forth the evil of ſin more than this, that the Commandment of God which doth forbid it, curſe it, condemn it, ſhould improve it.

It is by a curſe of the firſt Covenant, coming upon to the word of God, that it is an occaſional means, luſt oppoſing it, to make ſin riſe the higher: and firſt it brings forth in a man ſins againſt knowledge, and afterwards ſins with malice and deſpight.

The <hi>Jews</hi> did ſtand much upon it, and doubtleſs it was a great mercy that unto them did belong the giving of the Law and the Promiſes, and unto them were committed the Oracles of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they reſted in, and made their boaſt of the Law, <hi>&amp;c.

And what fruit had moſt of them by the Law? it did aggravate their ſins in the guilt of them, and drew forth their ſins in the power of them, unto the greater height, and in many of them even to the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. And ſo it does many men that live under the Goſpel at this day, they have no other fruit by their ordinances, and of the word of God amongſt them, but to make them more exceedingly wicked.</p>

                  <p n="1">§. 1. THere is a double ſenſe of theſe words given by Interpreters, and both may very well be put together. The Apoſtle having ſaid before, <hi>That in a godly man there are two contrary principles, fleſh and ſpirit, and they luſt and act one againſt another, ſo that they cannot do the things they would, but when they would do good evil is preſent with them;</hi> he adds here a conſolation to bear up their hearts in this, which is the greateſt conflict upon earth, between fleſh and ſpirit in the ſame heart, and that which made them to look upon themſelves as miſerable men all their days, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24, <hi>but if you are led by the ſpirit you are not under the law:</hi> that is, though there be a principle of fleſh in you, and this principle is ſinful, contrary to the Law, and condemned by the Law; yet it ſhall never prevail to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn you, though it will many times to defile you, for you are not under the Law for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: they may be and will be matter of your trouble and affliction here, but never the matter of your condemnation hereafter. And ſo the meaning is, that the godly that have received the ſpirit of Grace, and ſubmit themſelves willingly to be acted and guided thereby, though they have the remainders of ſin in them that deſerve death, yet they ſhall never infer death; becauſe they are not for the condition of their perſons under the Laws condemning power, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. Though there be in the Saints matter of condemnation, yet there is in them no actual condemnation. There is a ſecond interpretation given of it, and that is, That though there be remainders of ſin, contrary luſtings within you, ſo that you cannot do the things you would do, but all your performances <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> blemiſhed and defiled; as a Collier and Fuller dwelling in the ſame houſe, what the one whites, the other pollutes: Yet this ſhall not make your ſervices hateful before God, ſhall not hinder their acceptation; for you are not under the rigor and conviction of the Law, requiring perfect obedience, or elſe it cannot be accepted, as it is with all unregenerate men: but you are not ſo under the Law, neither ſhall this contrary principle be wholly able to hinder you in duties; for you are not under the Law conſtraining you, and <hi>forcibly compelling</hi> unto duty, without giving you ſtrength to perform it; but you have a ſpirit within you, as well as a rule without you, the one directing, and the other aſſiſting and inabling. Both theſe will make one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat ſenſe, and are for conſolation to the condition of thoſe that are in Chriſt; that though corruptions may remain in them, yet they ſhall never prevail againſt them to their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, neither ſhall they hinder their acceptation with the Lord in the midſt of all their failings.</p>
                  <p>We muſt conſider that the diſpenſations of God to every man are according to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant under which he ſtands, and the adminiſtrations of both Covenants are ever ſince the fall in the hand of Chriſt as Mediator; he diſpenſeth the Curſe of the firſt Covenant as well as the Grace of the ſecond; and at the day of Judgment it is the Man Chriſt Jeſus that ſhall ſay to the wicked, <hi>Go you curſed,</hi> as well as to the Saints, <hi>Come you bleſſed, &amp;c.</hi> Now for the adminiſtration of all things according to this great truſt, Jeſus Chriſt as Mediator has received the ſpirit as a ſpirit of union, and a ſpirit of unction: and this ſpirit is the <hi>viceroy,</hi> or <hi>prorex,</hi> that works all the works and all the adminiſtrations of Chriſt in this great King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: only he diſpenſes this ſpirit to ſome as a Lord, and to others as a head, unto ſome only as a ſpirit of qualification for ſervice, unto others as a ſpirit of ſanctification for their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that all that Chriſt does, he does by the ſpirit; and anſwerable unto the condition of the perſon, ſo is the ſpirit that works in him: all is wrought ſuitably unto the Covenant under which he ſtands; if the man be under the firſt Covenant he is a bondman, for his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant genders unto bondage, and all the works of the ſpirit of God in that man are only the works of bondage, and this ſpirit is a ſpirit of fear. There is a double ſpirit by which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52030:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> wicked men are acted: there is a ſpirit of the world, that works effectually in the children of diſobedience; the ſtrong man armed keeps the houſe, and they are taken by him, as beaſts taken alive and led captive at his will:<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.26.</note> and this ſpirit does act them wholly in moſt of the acts of their lives; but God has reſerved unto himſelf a Judicature in the man, and that is Conſcience, but this commonly works not: there is a fearedneſs, a ſpirit of ſlumber and ſenſleſneſs, a being paſt feeling, that ſin has brought upon it; but ſometimes the ſpirit of God comes into the Court of Conſcience, and awakens it, and then it ſpeaks in Gods name unto the man, and therefore it is ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and it is always a <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs,</hi> Rom. 9.1. A renewed Conſcience can never work of it ſelf, nor witneſs of it ſelf; neither does a natural Conſcience, but as it is acted by the ſpirit of God. Now if the man be in the condition of a ſervant, the ſpirit does witneſs unto him, and ſpeaks in his Conſcience nothing but fear and bondage; and therefore it is called, anſwerable to the condition of the man, a ſpirit of bondage. But if the man be under the ſecond Covenant, and in the condition of a ſon, then the ſpirit does ſpeak peace, favour and acceptance unto him, and liberty, and is a ſpirit of Sonſhip. Not that in a godly man there is never any thing elſe ſpoken; but from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15, where the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>You have not received the ſpirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the ſpirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba, father,</hi> I conclude, The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God never ſpeaks bondage to a godly man; that he is in a ſtate of bondage and death, and binding a man over to wrath again; though ſometimes God leaving a man unto the ſpirit of Satan, he may ſpeak ſo in his heart, and tell him he is unregenerate, and then the darkneſs of a mans own ſpirit may be apt to gather ſuch concluſions: but the Spirit of God does never ſpeak any thing unto a Saint concerning his eternal ſtate but liberty, after his tranſlation out of the firſt Covenant. Every regenerate man having received the Spirit of Chriſt, and his Covenant being changed, this ſpirit has undertaken to be <hi>dux viae,</hi> his <hi>guide,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 16.</note> to lead him on in his way, till he comes to glory. Now a man that is in Chriſt, and has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit of Chriſt, and is led by that Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. that man is not under the Law neither for condemnation, nor for coaction; therefore every man that is out of Chriſt, and not led by this Spirit, but has received a ſpirit of bondage, he is under the Law both theſe ways.</p>

                     <hi>That every man that is out of Chriſt is under the coaction and rigor of the Law. Auſtin</hi> upon this place in the <hi>Galatians</hi> makes a fourfold ſtate of man. (1) <hi>Ante legem, before the Law;</hi> when a man did ſin without the knowledg of ſin, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it without reſtraint or controul; and ſo it is with many men that lay the reins upon their luſts necks. (2) <hi>Sub lege, under the law, &amp;c.</hi> when a man does ſtrive againſt ſin, his Conſcience being convinced that it is ſin, but yet he is over-come though he does ſtrive. (3) <hi>Sub gratia, under Grace;</hi> though many times in the fleſh they ſerve the law of ſin, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetudine paenali, by a penal cuſtome,</hi> yet they do ſtrive againſt it, and they are not wholly overcome; ſin doth not reign in their mortal bodies. (4) <hi>In pace, in peace,</hi> when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict is perfectly ended, the victory is won, and ſin is perfectly overcome; as it is in Heaven, when they ſhall enter into reſt and peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Every man out of Chriſt is in the firſt, or the ſecond rank; either he is without the Law, as <hi>Paul</hi> was, and does go on in ſin without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul, becauſe without the Law ſin is dead; or elſe he is under the Law in the condemnation of it, and in the rigor and coaction of it. They that are in Chriſt here are under grace; and the ſouls of juſt men made perfect, that are tranſlated into Glory, they are entred into peace, each walking in his uprightneſs while they were here below.</p>
                  <p>The beſt way to open this rigor and coaction of the Law, will be to ſhew <hi>wherein it does conſiſt, and how a man out of Chriſt is under it, and how in Chriſt he is delivered from it.</hi> The Law exacts of a man perfect obedience, or elſe there is no acceptation either of his perſon or his works. God had no reſpect to <hi>Cain</hi> and to his offering,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.4.</note> becauſe of the failing that was in it, <hi>had he done well he ſhould have been accepted:</hi> and therefore ſee the glorious ſervice of <hi>Jehu,</hi> to which God gave ſo great a teſtimony,<note place="margin">2 King. 10.31.</note> 
                     <hi>that he had done what was right in Gods eyes, and according to all that was in his heart;</hi> and yet <hi>Jehu</hi> had a by-end, which blaſts all his ſervice, and turns it into murder in Gods account; for <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.4, he ſays, <hi>He will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the houſe of Jehu.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bona opera non renato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum mortalia.</note> So in all the ſervices of unregenerate men <hi>their good works are mortal ſins;</hi> God rejects them all for the leaſt failing, and there is nothing counted a prayer, or an alms, or hearing, or any duty: and this is a rigor and a great ſtraight that every unregenerate man is in, he muſt pray; and yet becauſe he cannot pray without ſin, therefore his prayer is an abomination to the Lord, and there is nothing that he can do is accepted with the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Now from this rigor a man in Chriſt is freed; there is an imperfection in the beſt ſervices of the Saints, which they deſire God not to enter into judgment with them for: and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> can pray to be pardoned, and yet to be remembred and rewarded for the ſame actions; for
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52030:42"/> there is fleſh and ſpirit in the ſame man,<note place="margin">Terret me vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta mea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Anſelm.</note> and they act and luſt one againſt the other in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the man does; which have made ſome of the Saints look upon their life with horror: and yet if the man be in Chriſt the duty is accepted, and the other rejected that is out of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Apparet mihi aut peccatum, aut ſterilitas, tota vita mea. Phil. 4.18. 2 Cor. 8.12.</note> becauſe their perſons and ſervices are not accepted in the beloved; and if found in him the meaneſt ſervice is accepted, if it be but giving an alms it is an offering of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour, and is well-pleaſing unto God; a willing mind is accepted according to what a man has: but a man out of Chriſt is under the rigor of the Law for the acceptation of his ſervices; they muſt be perfect, or elſe they ſhall be rejected of God for their leaſt failings.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Law exacts duties of every unregenerate man, but it gives a man no ſtrength to perform them; for <hi>Lex reſpicit hominem conditum,</hi> the <hi>Law regards man created,</hi> as having received ſtrength from God to perform it, and requiring ſtrength gives it not; <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy might;</hi> not only with all the ſtrength thou haſt, but with all that I gave thee in thy creation. But the Goſpel does reſpect man fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, and therefore requires not duty by a mans own ſtrength. The Law forbids ſin, and lays the burden of duties upon a man, but gives no ſtrength to bear it, which becauſe a man through ſin has loſt, therefore he ſinks under it for ever. So that the Law to a natural man is like the <hi>Egyptian</hi> task-maſters, it calls for the whole tale of bricks, but yet there muſt no ſtraw be given. The Law gives a man no ſtrength, and yet it calls upon every unregenerate man for perfect obedience, though he be dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, and cannot ſo much as think a good thought. But to a man in Chriſt it is far otherwiſe, the Law calls for duty, and the Goſpel gives the ability to perform it; <hi>for there is a promiſe goes with the command,</hi> if the Lord command you to cleanſe your ſelves, he ſaith, <hi>I will pour out clean water, and you ſhall be clean from your filthineſs;</hi> if he requires, <hi>that you ſhould be fruitful in every good word and work,</hi> he does promiſe, <hi>that you ſhall grow up as willows by the water-courſes, and as calves of the ſtall,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The deſart ſhall bloſſome as a roſe, they ſhall bring forth fruits in their old age; they ſhall be fat and flouriſhing; their beauty ſhall be as the olive-tree, and their ſmell as Lebanon.</hi> He ſays, <hi>Make you a new heart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>a new heart alſo will I give you.</hi> Again, ſaith he, <hi>Thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God;</hi> and he promiſeth, <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall never depart from me.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart;</hi> and he promiſes, <hi>I will circumciſe your hearts to love, &amp;c.</hi> It is in Goſpel, as it is in the body, there are veins and arteries, the blood is conveyed in the one, and the ſpirits in the other; if there were blood without ſpirits there would be nothing but weakneſs, but the Goſpel takes both together, the ſpirits with the blood; ſo that a man in Chriſt is free from the rigor of the Law, alſo in this reſpect, that it requires duty but gives no ſtrength to perform what it requires.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To an unregenerate man though it command duty, yet it lays it upon him as a burden which he hates; it commands duty but it gives him no inward love to it, or delight in it, and yet he muſt do it though he hates it: a duty without is required, but a principle of love within is not ingrafted, ſo that a wicked man doth duties as a godly man does commit ſins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7, <hi>That which I hate that do I.</hi> 1 Tim. 1.9, <hi>The law is not made for a righteous man.</hi> Some place the emphaſis in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>it is not laid upon him as a burden,</hi> which he hates and deſires to be freed from, but he has a law of love within him, an inward principle that anſwers the law without,<note place="margin">Heb. 8.10.</note> a law written in his heart, an inward and ſecret Bible, that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways carries with him, that though he were not forced to it by a law without, yet there is in his heart an inward principle, a law within. And therefore <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> doth diſtinguiſh men into two ſorts that make uſe of the law, <hi>men that live under the law, and men that live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the law;</hi> that is, that have not only a law without commanding, but within a law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining; ſo that a man out of Chriſt is under the law as a yoke, and as a burden that no man is able to bear, which he hates but cannot love.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To an unregenerate man though the law command duty, yet as he cannot love it, ſo he can take no delight in it: it does indeed exact it of him, but ſo as he groans under it, and does ſnuff at it, and ſays, <hi>what a wearineſs is it;</hi> and his heart loaths it, and he can take no pleaſure in it, from day to day, he looks upon it as his only miſery, chains and fetters of iron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52030:42"/> he delights to wear; <hi>the ways of wiſdom are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths peace.</hi> And this I conceive to be the meaning of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6, <hi>To ſerve in the newneſs of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and not in the oldneſs of the letter:</hi> the oldneſs of the letter is only the letter requiring duty without, and the newneſs of the ſpirit is the heart delighted with duty within,<note place="margin">Spiritu novo &amp; ſpontaneo.</note> to ſerve God with a free and a Princely ſpirit.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The law forbids ſin, but it heals it not; it does revive it, but it does not caſt it out, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9, <hi>When the commandment came ſin revived and I died;</hi> it does ſhew men ſin, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their conſciences for it: but it is but as <hi>Ezekiels</hi> pot, <hi>the ſcum riſes and boils in again.</hi> Had <hi>Paul</hi> gone no further than the Law, ſin might have revived by that, and the man have died again, but ſin would never have died, that he might live: for though a man do abſtain from it for fear and out of a ſlaviſh ſpirit, yet he loves it ſtill, and deſires it ſtill; becauſe the law may keep a man from acting ſin, but it will never ſtir up a man to the hatred of ſin, and then a man is ſaid to be under the law indeed. <hi>Luther</hi> has a ſtory of one that did uſe to relate of himſelf, how it was with him before he was brought home to Chriſt; <hi>I more than a thouſand times promiſed to God in duties more than I could perform;</hi> and ſo he came at laſt to be out of hope ever to perform them, which he ſays was to him <hi>pia &amp; ſancta deſperatio, an holy deſpair;</hi> and this brought him home to Chriſt. When a man has lookt upon the law long, that ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adultery, and thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain,</hi> and yet the heart of the man is carried after the ſin; though he may abſtain from the outward act, yet his ſpirit boiles after it; he may pray againſt it, and vow againſt it, and yet ſtill the grace that muſt ſubdue it muſt come from the Goſpel. But now a man in Chriſt he has his nature changed, and ſo his pleaſures and delights are changed, and he ſays, <hi>I am not I,</hi> as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid. Others wonder how you can live without theſe things, that you were ſo much delighted with heretofore; alas! the new nature wonders as much at the old. A new nature brings new delights, and now <hi>ſuave eſt iſtis ſuavitatibus carere,</hi> it <hi>is ſweet to want thoſe ſweets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Law carries a man to God as a Judg. God does give the Law a Soveraignty, and ſo doth judg all men according to this Law, without reſpect of perſons, according to their works; which fills a mans Conſcience full of doubtful inquiries, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5, <hi>And the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the law ſays, who ſhall aſcend up to heaven or fetch Chriſt down, &amp;c.</hi> And a mans heart is full of jealouſie of God, and he does apprehend that he has offended God; he does wiſh there were no God. So the ſoul looks upon God as one that will ſtrictly obſerve what has been done amiſs, and he ſtands afar off from God, and cares not for coming near the Lord. But a man in Chriſt, the Goſpel carries him unto God as unto a Father; <hi>My Father,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>and your Father, my God, and your God.</hi> Mal. 3.16, <hi>He will ſpare them as a father does his ſon that ſerves him.</hi> He accepts of his endeavours, when there is a willing mind; he takes any thing well becauſe it is from a child. And there is an inward principle of affection and eternal love that carries God towards the man. And ſo in the mans approaches to God in duties there is a great deal of ſweetneſs and confidence, when in an other mans duties there is a great deal of terrour and amazement; becauſe in the one he comes to God as a Judg, through the exacting of the Law, and there he is full of fear, for he expects a dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſentence; and the other man comes to God as a Father, and he fears not accuſation nor a rejection.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It does force a man to ſee ſin whether he will or no, and ſets it, yea holds it before the mans eyes, when his deſire is to caſt it behind his back. There is no unregenerate man in the world, that is either willing to ſee his duty, or his iniquity and obliquity; not his duty, and therefore he caſts the Law of God behind his back as a thing that he is not willing to ſee, and is moſt willing to put away from him, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.26, <hi>And caſt the law behind their backs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 50.17: 2 Pet. 3.5.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſlew the Prophets which teſtified againſt them;</hi> and therefore they are ſaid, <hi>to hide their eyes, and to be willingly ignorant;</hi> neither would they ſee, and therefore they deſire not to look into that glaſs which diſcovers their ſins; but <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.21, <hi>They hate them that reprove in the gate:</hi> they have many pleas to juſtifie themſelves in an evil way, and to extenuate their ſins; and <hi>they do call light darkneſs, and darkneſs light, evil good, and good evil;</hi> and they love to have Prophets that ſhould call them ſo alſo.</p>
                  <p>Now comes the Law as a glaſs, and that diſcovers duty and makes men to ſee their ſins, and the duties that they hate, and the evil of the ſin which they love and delight in. The Law is in Scripture reſembled unto a glaſs, and a glaſs it is two ways, as it diſcovers duty: and ſo it is of uſe in four things;<note place="margin">Jam. 1.24.</note> (1) As a glaſs it ſhews to a man that holineſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52030:43" rendition="simple:additions"/> made under the Law, and anſwered the precept and the curſe; and the Lord rather required (if we may compare it) that the precept ſhould be fulfilled, than the curſe be born; becauſe the principal intention of the Lords giving the Law was obedience to the precept, and not the ſuffering of the curſe: now all that holineſs that was required of Chriſt and performed by him, either in nature or life, we may behold in the Law: thus the righteouſneſs of the Law is fulfilled in us, there is in our juſtification a commutation of the perſon, but not of the righteouſneſs. (3) The Law is unto the Saints a glaſs that ſhews them the obedience that the Lord doth require of them: the Goſpel indeed gives grace to obey, but the Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no other obedience but that which the Law does diſcover as a rule, <hi>a man muſt look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the perfect law of liberty and continue therein.</hi> Pſal. 119.6, <hi>I ſhall not be aſhamed when I have reſpect unto all thy commandments, &amp;c.</hi> (4) It is the glaſs of perfection in the life to come, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2, <hi>When he ſhall appear we ſhall be like him.</hi> There ſhall be a perfect conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in nature, and life in us unto the Law in all things, and we ſhall be every one of us living Scripture, and walking Bibles, for the word of the Lord is written in the heart, and turned into grace enduring for ever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here indeed we have little conformity to the Law of God, but hereafter our holineſs ſhall be perfected.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the Law is the knowledg of ſin; <hi>when the commandment came ſin revived, and I died.</hi> As a glaſs ſet before a man diſcovers his ſpots, and as the light coming into a dark place ſhews our filthineſs that before was hid. An unregenerate man would never ſee his ſin, nor ſearch himſelf, nor turn into his own heart and try his ways, if the Law did not make theſe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries. All reflex thoughts he hates; and if at any time he be forced into them, and hath a glimpſe of himſelf, that does affright him, that he does begin to ſee his own uglineſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and ſmell the ſavour of his own filthineſs, even the ſepulcher that is within him; he doth immediately turn from it as an unpleaſing ſight, which he is no ways willing to behold and fix his eyes upon:<note place="margin">Jam. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Beholding his natural face in a glaſs he forgets what manner of man he was.</hi> Though he may remember the notions of a Sermon that are ſpeculative to adorn his underſtanding, yet the diſcoveries of his own ſin and ſelf in a Sermon, he doth quickly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, and therein the main forgetfulneſs of a hearer of the Law lyes.</p>
                  <p>Now the Law has a conſtraining power, and ſets a mans ſins in order before him, and makes a man ſee his own vileneſs, and holds it to his eyes that he cannot look off it; but he crys out,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note>

So let all unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men go from one creature to another, and build Cities like <hi>Cain,</hi> and add to their recreation and pleaſures of ſin; yet ſtill the ſight of ſin is by the light in this glaſs ſet before them, and <hi>haeret lateri lethalis arundo, the mortal dart ſticks in his ſide.</hi>

And when Conſcience doth tell a man of the danger of ſin, and preſents to a man Hell and wrath as the conſequence of it, though it be a way that ſeems good to a man, yet it leads down to the chambers of death, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a man to the end of his journey, and tells him that the fiery lake is but a little before, and comes with the threatning of God as the Angel did to <hi>Balaam,</hi> with a drawn ſword in his hand: a man may ſay I will turn back again if my way be perverſe before thee, and he may turn away from the ſins that he loves moſt dearly, he may caſt up his vomit with the dog, and leave the mire with the ſwine; but it is only in fear of ſome evil, and not from a principle wrought in a man, that is the ground thereof. There is a double principle that moves all things, either a principle of life within, or elſe a principle from without; either weights or ſprings, as it is in Clocks or Watches, which makes the motion; ſo many men may move to duty, and abſtain from ſin not from an inward principle of life in the one or the other, but from a weight without.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. The more a regenerate man is acted by legal principles, and the leſs love he has to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual duties, the leſs ſpiritual he is; and therefore his deſire is always to be led by the Spirit of God, and he always prays to God for his free Princely Spirit.</p>

                  <head>SECT. III. <hi>The APPLICATION.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">§. 1. WE may hence learn what a miſerable eſtate a man is in being under the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: every thing is a burden to him, becauſe it is a conſtraint upon his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; the thing he does he hates; he has a contrary principle within him, which he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge and gratifie. Now there being in a man the ſame nature, and the command of God lying upon a man, this may and this does commonly put a force upon him to perform duties of the law, but that is never pleaſant, but always burdenſome, and the man deſires to be ſet at liberty; for he can never look upon the law as the perfect law of liberty, until his nature anſwers the law, and it is written in his heart.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If we look upon the reſtraint that the law does lay upon a man that is unregenerate, his condition is moſt miſerable; becauſe (1) he does abſtain from ſin, but it is forced, and therefore burdenſome, becauſe ſtill his luſt is active, and carries the man after it with inward burning, and the man is tormented the more; it is <hi>adding drunkenneſs to thirſt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 29.19.</note> The ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of luſt is compared unto drunkenneſs, and the luſt is compared unto thirſt, and as the drunkenneſs does increaſe the thirſt, and the more a man drinks the more thirſty he ſhall be, and therefore none calls for drink more than thoſe that have had too much already: ſo it is here, the more a man does to ſatisfie his luſt, the more he does increaſe it: We know what a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing thirſt is unleſs it be ſatisfied. <hi>He that believes ſhall never thirſt, but ſhall have a well of water ſpringing up in him,</hi> Joh. 7.38, 39. There is a double reſtraint, (1) upon mens acts: <hi>Abimelech</hi>'s luſt was ſtirred up, but the Lord with-held the act,<note place="margin">Gen. 20:</note> and ſo it was with the Phariſees, they had often as bloody deſires long before, and ſought to take Chriſt and put him to death, but they could not, there was a reſtraint put in for want of opportunity, or fear of the people, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (2) There is a reſtraint upon mens luſts: for though the heart of man be full of luſt, yet there is a Providence of God in permitting them to come forth, ſome at one time, and ſome at another; ſo that the ſeeds of thoſe ſins that were in men before, do now ſhew forth themſelves, as we ſee in <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Gehazi,</hi> and in many men, who carry it fair a while, till there be an opportunity to draw them forth; they have <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronis quinquennium,</hi> for five years <hi>Nero</hi> carried it fair, and yet afterwards he proved de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately wicked. Now this reſtraint upon mens acts, though unto the Elect of God it is a mercy, and any thing that may hinder them in a way of ſinning, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.6, 7, <hi>I will hedge their way with thorns, and I will make a wall againſt them:</hi> God can keep men from ſin whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or no; and if leſſer afflictions will not do it, God will raiſe greater: But yet for all this the luſts of natural men will go after their former lovers, though they cannot overtake them. And this is a great miſery unto ſuch men; firſt, look upon the Saints alſo and they have deſires after good, but they find oppoſition, ſo that they cannot do the thing that they would; but there is ſtill a law in their members rebelling againſt the law of their mind, and this makes them to look upon themſelves as miſerable men, becauſe they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires unſatisfied, and they do ſtill groan after a ſatisfaction; and this makes them weary of their lives, and they are willing to die that they may enjoy their deſire to the uttermoſt: and yet even in a regenerate man theſe deſires are but of half the man; and therefore in an unregenerate man when he is carried to ſin with his whole man, ſuch a ones deſires are more vehement, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.4, <hi>Their hearts are hot as an oven;</hi> they go out after it with greedineſs,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52030:45"/> and they look upon it as the greateſt miſery to be reſtrained from it, and their hearts riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any oppoſition ſo much the more; as you know <hi>Amnon</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> they were ſick, becauſe they were reſtrained from that which they would have. The ſoul of a wicked man is like a wild Bull in a net furiouſly bent upon ſin, they will periſh rather than be hindred in a way of ſinning. This the Devil looks on as his great miſery, that though God lay not reſtraint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his luſt, yet he reſtrains his acts, ſo that he cannot hurt mankind as he would do; though he ſmite <hi>Job</hi> with ſores, and imbitter his life to him, yet he ſhall not be able to take away his life: and the luſts of the Devil are as violent and as impetuous as ever; he deſires to winnow <hi>Peter;</hi> and there is bounds ſet him that he cannot do what he would, and his great torment is his reſtraint, and the chains of darkneſs with which he is held: and he could not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Judas</hi> that was his own, till by the Sop the Lord gave him leave; and he could not enter into the herd of Swine without licenſe: this is looked upon as a great miſery by that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and proud ſpirit. Look what reſtraint either the power of God, or the providence of God, lays upon the luſts of the Devil, the ſame does the Law of God lay upon the luſts of unregenerate men; and this they look upon as their miſery, that they cannot enjoy their full deſires: there is an inward boiling of ſpirit, and their hearts are hot as an oven; they deſire but they cannot attain, and ſo their deſire is their torment, and they can have no reſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Even in thoſe pleaſures of ſin that a man does enjoy, this reſtraint of the law will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter them to a man exceedingly, that a man does not enjoy them with that ſweetneſs and delight, that otherwiſe he ſhould do, becauſe the ſentence of the law, and the judgments of God follow him with threats, ſo that ſtill they do add water to his wine, and mix it with greater diſcontent than he ſhould otherwiſe have; for a man comes to it with a guilty galled and ſelf-condemning conſcience, and ſo he can take no pleaſure, or but half the pleaſure that elſe he ſhould take; and therefore the endeavour of the man is to put out the eye of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and to make it grow ſenſleſs, and to caſt off this yoke, and reſtraint of the law dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more and more; and the more a man caſts it off, the more pleaſure he does take in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. As a godly man that has taſted of the ſweetneſs of Communion with God, he cannot take that pleaſure in ſin that other men do; becauſe ſtill at the remembrance of his former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion the ſweetneſs of it does ariſe in his heart, and therefore he ſays it was better with me than it is now; ſo alſo an unregenerate man, that has taſted the bitterneſs of ſin in the Law, and the terrours thereof, and has had the reſtraint of it laid upon his Conſcience, he cannot taſte the like pleaſure that other men do in ſinning; only the one is from a principle of conviction only, and the other of converſion. This is the miſery of an unregenerate man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reſtraints of the Law of God, either his luſts do rage within, and he cannot act them, and therefore he wiſhes that there were no law; or elſe if he do commit them, it is but with half the man, becauſe the law binds him over unto wrath, and tells him <hi>that ſin lies at the door.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. If we look upon the conſtraint, the miſery is as great alſo; as not to do the thing we would, ſo to be forced to do the thing we would not, is no ſmall miſery: and therefore, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.13, <hi>They ſay, what a wearineſs is it;</hi> which ſome render a weakneſs, <hi>defatigatio,</hi> and ſome <hi>moleſtia,</hi> a <hi>trouble,</hi> and all is becauſe there is a force without, contrary to a principle within. <hi>Haman</hi> was by the command of the King forced to lead <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s Horſe, and to proclaim before him, <hi>This ſhall be done unto the man whom the King delights to honour:</hi> how may we conceive this went againſt his ſpirit, and it was as bitter to him even as death it ſelf; and the reaſon was becauſe he had in him an inward principle of enmity and contrariety a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Mordecai;</hi> and ſo it is with every unregenerate man towards God, and therefore though the law does force them to an outward obſervance, yet they do hate that very out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward obedience that they do perform, and the law that enjoins it. When the Saints of God have been commanded to do outward honour and obſervance to the dunghil gods of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, (for ſo they are called) they have choſen death rather, from an inward principle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they hated obedience to falſe Gods. Now as a godly man would count it a miſery, and the greateſt burden of his life to be forced to bow himſelf before an Idol, ſo there is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of enmity in a wicked man unto the true God; for they are all enemies to God, and ſo they do hate to do obſervance alſo, and any outward obedience unto the true God: and as a godly man hates his ſins becauſe he is tempted to them by the law of his fleſh, ſo does a wicked man hate duties, becauſe he is led captive to them by the law of the Lord; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatever they do in outward appearance, they do it not before the Lord, becauſe they hate it when they do it.</p>
                  <p n="2">§. 2. We may hence learn the ground of all that hypocriſie and flattery that is expreſſed by unregenerate men towards God and Chriſt, whom they hate with a perfect hatred; it is all of it from the conſtraint of the law: and as the coaction of the law has a further place
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52030:45"/> in men, ſo is a mans hypocriſie the deeper, and becomes either groſs hypocriſie, or formal hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, as Divines do commonly diſtinguiſh it; the one is hid from others, and the other from a mans ſelf, and yet all this while the man does but act a part as a Stage-player, for ſo the name <hi>Hypocrite</hi> ſignifies. And therefore we ſee unregenerate men abſtain from thoſe luſts which they dearly love, and are brought to outward conformity in duties which they do truly hate, and have no inward principle to perform. We ſee the humiliation of <hi>Ahab, &amp;c.</hi> and the obſervation and reformation of <hi>Herod,</hi> the diſſembled obedience, and forced flattery of the wicked <hi>Jews;</hi> and in the offers of other ungodly men at Religion,<note place="margin">Pſal. 78 34, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>5 36</note> and their hot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning upon the ways of God. But all this proceeds only from the Coaction of the Law, and the power that it has even upon the hearts and conſciences of the worſt of men. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.14,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 8.14.</note> it is ſaid, <hi>For Iſrael has forgotten his maker and buildeth Temples, &amp;c.</hi> A man would think, that they that did build Temples had God much in their mind, and did honour him highly, building a Temple to his honour; but yet all this was done in Hypocriſie, and Will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. They that repaired and beautified the Sepulchres of the Saints departed, that were put to death, ſurely it did argue they did highly eſteem them, and they did it in honour both of their perſons and graces, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did to the perſon of Chriſt, and the Phariſees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.29. who did build the Sepulchers of the Prophets; yet Chriſt ſaid, it was all in hypocriſie, for while they pretended to honour the Saints, they did ſeek to deſtroy him that was the King of Saints. Thus we ſee mens taking up an outward conformity unto the Law of God, and ſome inward ſuitableneſs, as being enlightned by the Holy Ghoſt, taſting of the heavenly gifts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is the higheſt kind of hypocriſie; ſuch as is in a temporary believer, who has the greateſt ſhews of love to Chriſt and to duty: and all this proceeds from this coactive power of the Law, that God has upon the conſcience of unregenerate men; and this may come to a great deal of ſeeming delight, and a man may ſeem to take great ſatisfaction in it. The Lord ſays of Iſrael, <hi>They delight to know my ways, with their mouth they ſhew much love,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 58.2.</note> 
                     <hi>but their hearts go after their covetouſneſs,</hi> Ezek. 33.31. And many ſeem to have a great deal of ſeeming zeal for God and duty: and Chriſt ſays,<note place="margin">Joh. 16.2.</note> 
                     <hi>The time will come when they that kill you ſhall think they do God good ſervice.</hi> And <hi>Luther</hi> ſays of himſelf, <hi>Tantus eram ſanctus, ut para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſimus fuerim omnes ſi potuiſſem occidere,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I was ſo great a Saint</hi> (in mine own eſteem) <hi>that I was ready to ſlay all if I could, &amp;c.</hi> And this he did not for worldly ends, and for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage ſake, but out of a blind zeal for Religion. Therefore they that take away the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining of the Magiſtrate in the things of Religion upon this ground, becauſe it will but make men Hypocrites; may upon this ground take away the reſtraining power of the Law of God alſo. In ſome reſpects, as to prevent the outward diſhonouring God before men, and corrupting of others, it were to be wiſhed that all unregenerate men were come ſo far as to be Hypocrites; and it was not wiſhed amiſs of the Father, who ſaid, <hi>I could wiſh that all were Hypocrites.</hi> It were better in reſpect of other men, and honouring God before the world, though it would be never the better in reſpect of a mans ſelf; for feigned love, and ſecret flattery, is in Gods account as bad as open enmity; nothing ſo dangerous in men; eſteem as a falſe friend; <hi>Judas</hi> was more hateful to Chriſt than all his Perſecutors, becauſe he came to betray the Son of man with a kiſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">§. 3. The next Uſe is of Examination: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>4</label> Seeing that the Law has this power even upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate men, that it can reſtrain from ſin, and conſtrain to duty, and that godly men do duty and abſtain from ſin, by vertue of the law written in their hearts; how ſhall a man know that he abſtains from ſin, and does duty by the law of his mind, from an inward principle in his heart, or elſe is only conſtrained from a law without, and not from a law within? (for the Love of Chriſt conſtrains the Saints to deny all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts.) Whether we forbear to ſin, and abſtain from it, and perform duty, and be much in it from reſtraining Grace, or renewing Grace? Whether we do ſerve God in the newneſs of the ſpirit,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.6.</note> or the oldneſs of the letter? It was before converſion but a dead letter to him, and did only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand duty, but it did no way transform the ſoul in the inward man; but there is in a man being regenerate the newneſs of ſpirit, that is a mans inward man being renewed by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the rules of Trial are theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let a man by the Coaction of the Law be put upon duty never ſo much, and never ſo often, yet it will never aſſiſt him; nay, the more he doth duty, the leſs ſtrength he ſhall have to do it, the weakneſs of his nature will increaſe by it; as the longer he does abſtain from ſin, the more the luſt will ſpread, and the ſtronger it will grow: the more he does pray the leſs love he ſhall have to the duty; and though he may get a dexterity in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward performance, yet the leſs he ſhall be able to perform it in a ſaving and ſpiritual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: whereas renewing Grace gives a man ſtrength, a mans heart is prepared to pray, and the ſpirit of Grace is a ſpirit of ſupplication; a man has an Unction from the Holy Ghoſt,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52030:46"/> that flows from his union with Chriſt, and from the Holy Ghoſt; and he has a ſtrength in duties, the more he does them, the ſtronger he grows in all the ways of God. <hi>The righteous ſhall grow ſtronger and ſtronger, and he that has clean hands ſhall hold on his way,</hi> Job 17.9. and ſhine brighter and brighter, and grow ſtronger and ſtronger; the more he knows, the more he does follow on to know the Lord. And whereas another man has done duty many years, and is grown more weary of it, and more formal in it, but knows no more what does belong to the ſpiritual performance of it now, than he did when he began it; and he does poſſibly abſtain from ſin, but it is not from an inward principle and power of holineſs, but from an external motive, which only keeps it under in the courſe of his life; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although by abſtaining the luſt may ſeem weakned, and to decay by degrees, yet really it grows, and they prove more deſperately wicked; as appears by men that the unclean ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is gone out of, and returns with ſeven worſe ſpirits; and they that have made great and goodly ſhews of Holineſs, yet afterwards fall into the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A man that does duty from the Coaction of the Law is <hi>partial</hi> in it, and takes notice only of thoſe duties to which he is conſtrained, and where the law of God lays a ſtrong hand upon him; but as for other things he is not at all ſolicitous. <hi>Herod</hi> will do many things, but other things that either the Law does not ſo immediately and earneſtly preſs upon him, or his luſt will not diſpenſe with, thoſe he will leave undone. But renewing Grace makes a man to have reſpect unto all Gods Commandments, and to hate every falſe way; it ſets a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt every ſin, but ſpecially againſt a <hi>mans own iniquity,</hi> and thoſe ſins that are ſpiritual, that are from Satan, <hi>per modum imaginis,</hi> as <hi>part of his image,</hi> wherein they are moſt like the Devil.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All that a man does from the Coaction of the Law will never laſt; a man may abſtain from ſin a while, but if a man have the nature of a dog he will return to his vomit, and as a Sow will wallow in the mire ſtill, waſh her never ſo clean; yea, he will return with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter greedineſs, by reaſon of the former abſtinence, and ſo a man may perform duty a while; but as <hi>Job</hi> ſays, <hi>Will the hypocrite pray always?</hi> For he is but as a flag that cannot grow without mire; and if once the fleſhly reſpects of ſetting upon duty be taken away, his duties will wither: <hi>For either praying will make a man leave ſinning, or ſinning will make him leave praying:</hi> or if not publickly, yet will at leaſt kill all his ſecret duties, and make thoſe that are publick, degenerate wholly into a form.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whatſoever a man does by Coaction of the Law, a man has no ſweetneſs in it, it is with no delight and complacency; for things forced are not pleaſant: let a man do the leaſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that he is forced to, and it is a burden; whereas let the greateſt works in the world, and the moſt toilſome be done, if a man undertake them willingly, he can find pleaſure in them; as we ſee men do in recreations, running and wreſtling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So to a Saint the yoke of Chriſt is a pleaſing yoke, and his burden light; a ſoul can dance under it, and the thoughts of his leaving ſin is very pleaſant to him; and when he does duty he delights in it according to his inward man, and his ſoul is ſatisfied as with marrow and fatneſs, he is then in his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when he is keeping the Commandments of God. Set water over the fire and make it boil never ſo much, yet take it off, and it will return quickly into its former coldneſs, and will be the colder for its former heating: and ſo it is here, it is not agreeable to nature, and therefore can never be pleaſing, either for an unregenerate man to perform duty, or for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man to commit ſin.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Whatever a man doth by the Coaction of the Law, a man hath no communion with God thereby, nor is he drawn nearer unto God. A gracious heart is ſenſible of the want of God, and therefore his end in all that he does is to ſeek God, that he may find him; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in Ordinances God will be found, and has there promiſed a ſpecial preſence, therefore he ſeeks him there; and he labours to ſtir up his Graces in his approach to God, and God does in mercy draw near unto him, becauſe what he does is from an inward principle of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs: but a man that does duty from a natural conſcience only, he does not draw near to God, but his ſpirit draws back all the while, and looks upon God as an enemy; and therefore he has no fellowſhip with the Lord. The Law indeed puts him upon duty, and as a task he doth it, but he has no more experience of the approaches of God in it, or his love, or the power of his Grace, the kiſſes of his mouth, the ſtayings of God with flaggons, and comforting with apples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but a ſoul that does duties from a principle of godlineſs, is ſenſible of his ſpiritual abſence from God in duties, and of his ſpecial preſence, and would not loſe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in duties for a world; but other men are ſatisfied in the duties meerly, and their ſinning and hearing is much alike to them; and if they have done the duty, conſcience is ſatisfied and they have all they deſire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>4</label> §. 4. Here we ſee what a happineſs it is to the Saints, that they are freed from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of the Law, that they are not ſo under it as unregenerate men are: For (1) they do
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52030:46"/> no good by conſtraint. The regenerate man is always ready to obey the will of God, he is a man that acts from an inward principle, and therein lives above the Law; he that is born of God never ſins, but always obeys God;<note place="margin">1 John.</note> every thing that the Law commands is pleaſant to him, and the Commandments of God are not grievous;<note place="margin">Cant. 3.10.</note> as Chriſts Chariot in which he comes to us is paved with Love, ſo is our way to Chriſt paved with Love, and hence a man is never weary; but the longer a man continues in the ways of God, the more he is ſatisfied with them, becauſe where is a ſuitableneſs, there is no wearineſs: the Sun is not weary with ſhining, nor the fire weary with burning, nor are the Angels in Heaven ever weary of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding God for ever, becauſe their happineſs is perfected by it; nor are the Saints in earth weary of doing the will of their Heavenly Father, neither doing-work nor ſuffering-work; to bear Chriſts Croſs is not grievous to them, to be reproached for his name's ſake is counted all joy; they deſpiſe the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon, living in the ſure hope of their enjoying rivers of pleaſures that are at Gods right hand for evermore.</p>

In the latter part of this Chapter there are mainly two things we are to conſider; (1) <hi>The honour of our Redeemer.</hi> (2) <hi>The manner of our Redemption.</hi> The honour of our Redeemer is ſet forth from <hi>verſ.</hi> 15, and the manner of our Redemption, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13, 14; and that in many particulars. Here we may obſerve, (1) The condition, wherein the people of God are before their Converſion: [1] <hi>They are under the power of darkneſs.</hi> [2] <hi>They are out of the Kingdom of Gods dear Son.</hi> (2) Their condition after Converſion, <hi>They are freed, there is deliverence, &amp;c. and there is tranſlation unto the Kingdom of his Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. By nature every man is under the power of darkneſs, even the Elect of God as well as others. The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which does properly ſignifie <hi>right</hi> and <hi>authority over any thing.</hi> Man did by the firſt temptation ſell himſelf to the Devil, and as it were made a vertual covenant and compact with Satan: and as it's ſaid of <hi>Ahab,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Quod vendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur tranſit in poteſtatem emptoris.</note> 
                     <hi>He ſold himſelf to work iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> ſo it is with all by nature. And therefore God in judgment gave man over unto the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Sin, and therein to the dominion of Satan; and then Satans godſhip came in, and he became the god of this World, and the Prince of the power of the air. By <hi>darkneſs</hi> is meant in Scripture, <hi>ignorance, ſin and miſery;</hi> and of all this darkneſs, Satan is the Prince, and has the power, he is the ruler of the darkneſs of this world.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.12.

                  <p>Now how comes Satan to have a condemning power? the power of death it is by ſin: and how came ſin to have a condemning power? it is by the Law, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56. that is,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.14.</note> the Law as a Covenant. So that all the power Satan has it is by ſin; and the power that ſin has it is from the Law, as a Covenant being broken.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52030:47" rendition="simple:additions"/> under the power of ſin, and under the dominion of Satan. Now a mans deliverance from this is by conqueſt and by power: for it is in the <hi>Greek</hi>

                  <p>But man being under the power of darkneſs, he is out of the Kingdom of Chriſt, which is a Kingdom of Righteouſneſs, and free Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. He is free from this, for he is under the power of darkneſs or condemnation, becauſe under the power of the Law, and under the dominion of him that has the power of death, that is, the Devil; and Chriſts Kingdom is a Kingdom of light and holineſs, but they are under the power of darkneſs; ſin having by their Covenant dominion over them, and they being by Satan led captive at his will, and being acted by the ſpirit of the power of the air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

This is the Tranſlation that is here meant, a change of a mans ſtate, through the change of his Covenant; upon which follows the change of his image, and the change of his nature alſo. A man is tranſlated into it, (1) As a Kingdom of Righteouſneſs, by the change of his Covenant. (2) As a Kingdom of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by the change of his Image.</p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>All thoſe that are in Chriſt have a change of their ſtate, they are tranſlated out of their former Covenant.</hi> Here are two things to be ſpoken to: (1) <hi>That the Scripture does ſpeak of ſuch a Tranſlation or change of Covenant.</hi> (2) <hi>The neceſſity of ſuch a change, and the reaſons and grounds thereof.</hi>

Says the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.24, <hi>For if thou wert cut out of the Olive-tree which is wild by nature, and wert grafted contrary to nature into a good Olive-tree: how much more ſhall theſe which be the natural branches, &amp;c.

Therefore here are men that are wild Olives that are ingrafted, here are branches bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off that are ingrafted in again. So that in Converſion there is an Ingrafting, a Tranſlation of a man from one ſtock to another, from one root unto another, and that is by changing of a mans Covenant; for it is by his Covenant only that <hi>Abraham</hi> is his root, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some indeed are ingrafted only by an outward profeſſion, ſome by inward implantation into the inward and ſpiritual part, ſome into the outward priviledges of the Covenant only, but ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the ſweetneſs and fatneſs of the true Olive-tree,<note place="margin">Joh. 5.24.</note>

All the Ancients do generally make the Law the husband, from which a man being dead unto the Law is divorced: and ſome Modern Divines (as <hi>Beza</hi> and others) make ſin the husband, as being irritated by the law; but the thing is much the ſame: and a man being ingrafted into Chriſt is freed from the law of the husband. It is alſo a being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, and the main of our redemption lyes in it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5. as Chriſt was made under the law, ſo we were under it, now he was under it as a Covenant to fulfill the precept, and to ſatisfie the curſe; and he did this that he might redeem us that were under the law in both theſe reſpects; ſo that looking upon the law as a Covenant, Chriſt is ſaid to redeem us from being under it; changing a mans father and his mother,<note place="margin">Mich. 7.20.

So that this change of Covenant is in Scripture ſet forth by being cut off from the former root and ingrafted into another; a change or paſſage from a mans former ſtate, a being dead to a former husband, a redemption from a former bondage, an alliance to another father, and having a bond cancelled that was againſt a man by its exacting and condemning power.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. II.</hi> The neceſſity of a Tranſlation from the firſt Covenant.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THE neceſſity of this Tranſlation is manifeſted ſeveral ways. 1. From the nature of the Covenant as it is broken, and mans miſery under it; for the Covenant in ſelf is unchangeable and eternal, as well as the Covenant of Grace; and it ſays for ever, <hi>This do and thou ſhalt live;</hi> it ſtill ſays,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4, 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Curſed is every one that continues not in all things written in the Law to do them; the ſoul that ſins ſhall die.</hi> And to eſtabliſh it Chriſt was made under the Law, that the righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us; and what the Law ſaith, it ſaith unto them that are under the Law ſtill. So that while men continue under it, their former husband lives unto them, and the hand-writing ſtands in force againſt them: here is the benefit by Chriſt, a man may be tranſlated out of it, and ſo there may be a change of a mans Covenant, not by a change of the Covenant it ſelf, but by a change of the man, and his deliverance out of it.</p>
                  <p>Now ſo long as a man continues under this Covenant, (1) It promiſes no life but upon condition of perfect and perſonal obedience; it calls upon thee, <hi>To love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſtrength;</hi> the ſtrength that I gave thee at firſt: <hi>and the man that doth them ſhall live by them.</hi> There is <hi>commutatio perſonae,</hi> a <hi>commutation of the perſon,</hi> by the Covenant of Grace; but this Covenant ſaith not that the obedience of another ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted his unto juſtification and life, and ſo Juſtification is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, impoſſible by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Law; for by the Law no man can be juſtified; and in this it is weak through the fleſh; ſo that whileſt a man continues untranſlated, he can never be juſtified by the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, which can profit him nothing, becauſe in the ſenſe of the Law it is not his own righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) It is a Covenant without a Mediator: Chriſt indeed is a Mediator, but it is of the new Covenant; the firſt Covenant was <hi>faedus amicitiae,</hi> a <hi>Covenant of friendſhip,</hi> made with man in innocency; where there was no diſagreement; and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.20. <hi>A Mediator is not a Mediator of one, &amp;c.</hi> So that ſo long as a man is under the firſt Covenant, what benefits ſo ever there are to be had by the Mediation of Chriſt, he muſt go without them, either in reference to the preſentation of his perſon, or to the acceptation of his ſervices; for in the Covenant under which he ſtands a Mediator can have no place.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) In this Covenant there is no promiſe of pardon; but <hi>If thou doſt well thou ſhalt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52030:48"/> but if thou doſt evil ſin lyes at the door;</hi> and there is a curſe upon every tranſgreſſion, every ſin thou committeſt, every diſobedience has a juſt recompence of reward; ſo that as long as a man does continue under this Covenant, he muſt bear his own ſin, and there is no hope of pardon for him, becauſe under this Covenant God has promiſed no pardon. The aim of God was the glory of his Juſtice, and therefore the Lord deals with men as in Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: if there be a Capital crime committed, the Judge does not examine whether the man be penitent or no, and if he do repent, then there is a pardon for him; but whether the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence be committed or no, guilty or not guilty; and ſo Juſtice does all without reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a mans after-repentance. If thou haſt ſinned, the firſt Covenant ſays thou art a child of death; and when a man ſays, I have ſinned, it is the Covenant of Grace only that ſays, the Lord has put away thy ſin; but under this Covenant there is no pardon to be expected.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4) This Covenant promiſes no Grace: for it was made with man in his primitive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, when he had Grace anſwerable unto all the duties that the Lord required of him; he had a power to perform all duties, and to reſiſt all temptations, and this is ſuppoſed in every duty that is required, and in every ſin that is forbidden; ſo that all the promiſes of Grace and ſtrength that are in the ſecond Covenant, a man can never have benefit by, for they belong not unto the Covenant under which he ſtands unleſs he be tranſlated.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5) It is a Covenant that every ſin breaks, and being once broken it can never be made up again. So the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.16, <hi>By one offence guilt came upon all to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences to juſtification. Adam</hi>'s ſin was but one offence, and yet it brake his Covenant, and brought guilt and death upon all his poſterity, and that for ever; and his Covenant could bring death, but never juſtification and life any more, ſo that no man that has once ſinned could ever live by that Covenant any more: but it is not ſo in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, becauſe it brings in an everlaſting righteouſneſs, that ſin can never ſpend; and therefore though there be many offences yet the Covenant is not broken, but that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and life may be had therein; and the more ſin abounds, the grace of the Covenant abounds much more; as ſin takes occaſion by the law, ſo grace takes occaſion by ſin under the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="6">(6) It is a Covenant that can never quiet and ſettle the Conſcience, but let a man walk ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo exactly, and take never ſo much care to do his duty in all things, and let him live the holieſt life that ever any man did upon earth that was a ſinner, and he will be always in a doubt and full of jealouſie of God, whether he will accept him or no; as it was with the young man in the Goſpel, he had lived a very exact life according to the rules of a Phariſaical righteouſneſs; for he could ſay, <hi>All theſe things have I kept from my youth;</hi> and yet he was not quiet,<note place="margin">Gehennam horribiliter timuit.</note> he came and kneeled down to Chriſt and ſaid, <hi>What muſt I do to inherit eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life? what lack I yet?</hi> And ſo <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, he did endeavour in all things to walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Conſcience, and yet he ſays, <hi>I feared Hell terribly, &amp;c.</hi> And this is the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that the Apoſtle makes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5, 8, he prefers the righteouſneſs of faith before that of works, upon this ground, becauſe that of works is full of ſcruples and doubtful enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend up to Heaven?</hi> Doubting is the fruit of the Covenant of works; and therefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> muſt come to his <hi>Tutiſſimum,</hi> for unto men ſince the fall the fruits of the firſt Covenant are only doubting and anxiety: but faith tells a man, <hi>Chriſt has deſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the deep to make ſatisfaction there, and he is aſcended up on high into Heaven there to prepare a place;</hi> and there is nothing wanting for a mans ſalvation that Chriſt has not done, which frees a mans Conſcience from thoſe inward perplexities which the Covenant of works leaves a man intangled in. This is the firſt ground of the neceſſity of being tranſlated out of this Covenant, for ſo long as a man is under it this is his miſery, if he look for life it muſt be by his own righteouſneſs as without a Mediator; and if he ſin, there is no pardon for him, and if he be to do duty, there is no grace; if the Covenant be once broken it is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for ever, never made up again, for the leaſt offence; and a mans Conſcience can never be ſatisfied and quieted, till he does anchor upon Chriſt Jeſus, who is the rock of ages.</p>
                  <p n="2">§. 2. If God will deal with man in a Covenant-way, he muſt be tranſlated out of this Covenant, if he ever hope to receive any benefit by the ſecond Covenant; for no man can ſtand under both Covenants, no more than he can be born of two Mothers, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. the two Covenants are there compared unto two Mothers, and the Covenants are two roots; and 'tis impoſſible if one grow upon the one root, but he muſt be cut off from the other. I do confeſs that an unregenerate man, that is for the ſtate of his perſon under the Covenant of works, may have many outward benefits and priviledges from the Covenant of Grace. As (1) They are preſerved by it; for it is by the ſecond Covenant that the world ſtands, and it is for their ſakes that are heirs of bleſſing therein, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6, <hi>He is given as a Covenant to the Nations to eſtabliſh the earth;</hi> and it is by the Covenant of Grace to the Kingdom of Chriſt that the curſe of the firſt Covenant is not preſently executed upon wicked men.

(3) They have an imployment by Chriſt <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. it's ſaid, <hi>By me Kings reign;</hi> and that men are ſet in honourable places, and do ſervice in this Kingdom of Chriſt. <hi>Saul</hi> was made a King, and <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> was an Apoſtle. (4) They have great gifts given them by the Spirit of God diſpenſed in this Kingdom, which is only by the Covenant of Grace: they are inlightned, made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, taſte of the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come; they may propheſie in the name of Chriſt, and in his name caſt out Devils, and do many great works. (5) They have great priviledges given them, they are called the Sons of God, they have the Law and the Promiſes, they may live in the Church and claim an outward right unto Ordinances, and the offers of Grace as belonging unto them. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſon <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was circumciſed as well as <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and he had an outward right unto it, and ſo all external Church-priviledges Hypocrites may have a right unto, as <hi>Judas</hi> had among the other Diſciples, being undetected. (6) They may have for all theſe ſervices great Temporal rewards; labouring in the Lord's Vineyard they ſhall have their penny. <hi>Cyrus</hi> a Heathen Prince, yet doing works for God, he ſhall have a Kingdom for his reward; and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſhall have <hi>Egypt</hi> for his hire; great honours and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards before men, riches in abundance, that they may waſh their ſteps in butter: <hi>Iſhmael</hi> had the dew of Heaven, and the fatneſs of the Earth. Theſe and many other benefits unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men may have by the Covenant of Grace, who yet for the eſtate of their perſons are under a Covenant of Works: only unto all godly men they are all given as a bleſſing, and unto them that are unregenerate men they are all given as a curſe, and will be a means but to ripen their ſins, and add unto their account and condemnation; and therefore though a man may have many external benefits by the Covenant of Grace, who for the eſtate of his perſon is under the Covenant of Works, yet he cannot ſtand under both Covenants.</p>

But God did not deal with <hi>Adam</hi> in this way only, but alſo in a way of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, giving him a command, and promiſing life and bleſſedneſs upon his obedience; and all the Diſpenſations of God in his Government unto men ſince, have been by vertue of, and according unto the Covenant. Whilſt man ſtood all the bleſſings he did enjoy were by vertue of the Covenant God made with him; and ſince his fall, all the curſes that he has under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone are the curſes of the Covenant. So unto man in his fall God will deal with him ſtill the ſame way; there are ſome acts of Soveraignty and abſolute Dominion which he has reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to himſelf, he gives man what Law he pleaſeth, and according to his own pleaſure changes and abrogates Laws as he will; and he has out of his own abſolute Soveraignty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> to be the head of the regenerate, and he does as an act of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty make a Covenant with us in him, and accounts us one with him, and by a Soveraign Imputation counts his Righteouſneſs ours, and our ſins his, and calls things that are not as if they were. But yet though he will keep both ways of Government in his own hand, yet he has declared himſelf that in his ordinary way he will rule man by a Covenant, and according unto the rules of that Covenant he will diſpenſe himſelf in mercy or in wrath, according to the Promiſes, or the threatnings thereof: and though man has fallen and broken the firſt Covenant, and therefore now God might have dealt with him in a way only of Soveraignty and Prerogative; yet the Lord will keep himſelf unto a Covenant-way, and will ſo deal with man again; and therefore man having broken the firſt he will eſtabliſh the ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.

The Covenant of Works is a Covenant without a Prieſt, there is none to preſent a mans perſon, but he muſt ſtand before God in his own perſon: for the firſt Covenant was made with man immediately, there is none to bear his ſin, and there is none to offer his ſacrifice; for it was a Covenant made with man in the ſtate of integrity, wherein he needed none of theſe. <hi>Adam</hi> had no more need of a Prieſt in this eſtate than the Angels have; but now all unregenerate men that are under the Covenant as broken (while they do ſo continue) have no more benefit by a Prieſt than the Devils have, only to man there is a poſſibility and not unto them: but the ſecond Covenant is a Covenant with a Prieſt, and there is a threefold office of a Prieſt. (1) He does preſent their perſons, for he ſtands in their ſteads; he bears their names two ways, upon his heart, and upon his ſhoulders. (2) He offers a ſacrifice for their ſins, and does carry the blood into the moſt holy place, and doth ſprinkle it before the Mercy-ſeat.

Now it is with a man as it is with Chriſt, there are two natures in him, and they have two properties, the one eternal, and the other in time; the one is infinite, and the other finite; the one mortal, and the other immortal: but if we look upon his Sonſhip, that is but one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it reſpects his Perſon, <hi>filiatio eſt ſuppoſiti filiati, filiation is of a perſon;</hi> ſo though a man have two very different natures in him of fleſh and ſpirit, the one from Chriſt, and the other from Satan; and in the one a man does reſemble God, and in the other the Devil, yet they argue not two Covenants, <hi>quia faedus pertinet ad ſuppoſitum,</hi> the <hi>Covenant belongs to the perſon.</hi>

And let me tell thee, O ſoul, whoever thou art in ſuch a condition, thy miſery will be ſo much the greater, that thou haſt had a ſecond Covenant offered, and yet deſpiſeſt it, and in this <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> will come in againſt thee, and will condemn thee; for if they had had the offers that thou haſt had, they would have accepted of them, yet thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected them: nay, the Devils themſelves will be brought in againſt thee for thy condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and in this as thy ſin is greater, ſo will thy judgment be, for they never had an offer of any terms of peace made to them; they found themſelves ſhut up under wrath without hope, but thou haſt had offers and hopes all thy days; and this will be matter for that never-dying worm to feed upon at the laſt and great day, when the ſoul ſhall reflect ſeriouſly upon its by-paſt life: I neglected hopes and poſſibility, and it's now unreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable, though there was a time that the offers of mercy were made to me, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Grace made with me, by the common works of the Spirit of God, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; mercy was upon her knees to me, and I had as great poſſibility and probability to have found mercy as any other: there are ſome that lived under the ſame Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and offers of Grace with me, and many of them had never the opportunities that I have had, and yet I ſee them ſit down with <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and I am left out. And this will be the great miſery of many, I may ſay of moſt of the children of the Kingdom, they that live in the Church at the laſt and great day.</p>
                  <p n="3">§. 3. We may hence ſee the happineſs of all thoſe that are in Chriſt, even in this, that their Covenant is changed, and it was unto <hi>David</hi> the ground of all his comfort,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52030:52"/> that God had made with him this Everlaſting Covenant: and well it might be, for it was the foundation of all his happineſs, and his ſalvation. But you'l ſay, <hi>Wherein lies the glory of this condition of a ſouls being tranſlated from their former root?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Being tranſlated into this Covenant, God is reconciled to thee; for the Covenant of Grace is a Covenant of Peace and Reconciliation, ſo that the enmity between thee and God is taken up, and he looks upon thee as an enemy no more.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Being taken into Covenant with God again, there do many ſweet relations grow out of the Covenant: for the Lord ſaith, <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people: and the Lord is not aſhamed to be called their God:</hi> he is our father and husband, and our friend, we have as truly by Covenant an intereſt in all that is in God for our beſt good, as the Lord himſelf hath for his own glory; his power is made over to us as truly as if we had infinite power, and his mercy as if we had infinite mercy, and grace, and wiſdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Being once in Covenant, he becomes the ſon of God: a mans Covenant is a Covenant of Sonſhip, <hi>I will be their God and they ſhall be my ſons and daughters,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Behold what manner of love the father hath ſhewed unto us, that we ſhould be called the ſons of God:</hi>

And he is no other way Chriſts God and Father but by Covenant: for Chriſt took a new Covenant-right unto God as Mediator. And as we come under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, ſo doth the Lord in him become our God alſo, and we have a right unto him; and by looking unto God in Covenant, the ſpirit of a Chriſtian is upheld in the greateſt ſenſe of wrath, when the Lord did bruiſe and grind him to powder, making his ſoul an offering for ſin. A man out of this Covenant has no ground for his faith, nor bottom for any of his prayers.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is a Covenant that can never be broken, an Everlaſting Covenant, a Covenant of ſalt,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.</note> a Covenant that has a ſurety.

Therefore whatever you do, give diligence to make your calling and election ſure, which can never be without a Tranſlation into the Covenant of Grace.</p>

                  <p>In the opening hereof, there are Three things that I muſt lay down as grounds; 1. <hi>That God will deal with all men, not only in a way of Dominion, but in a way of Stipulation.</hi> So that men in Covenant with God, are of two ſorts, either regenerate, or unregenerate; Sons or Servants; Children of the bond-woman or of the free: and they that are unregenerate, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>emain under the Covenant of Works; they that are regenerate, are under a Covenant of Grace. There is a twofold univerſal Covenant made with all mankind, which Divines do call <hi>faedus univerſale,</hi> one made with <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, and with all man-kind. For the Curſe of his Covenant tranſgreſſed coming upon all, does plainly prove, that the bleſſing of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>It is a mans <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with either of theſe publick perſons, or repreſentative heads, that doth bring a man under either Covenant.</hi> If a man be one with the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> then he is under his Covenant; and if he be one with the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> then he is under his Covenant. <hi>The ground of a mans Covenant, is his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with him that is the head of his Covenant.</hi> This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in both: Men come not under the Angels Covenant, becauſe they are not one with them; the Lord Jeſus Chriſt proceeding from <hi>Adam,</hi> not in a natural way, but voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taking to himſelf the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and being made fleſh, therefore he does volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily and freely,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.5.</note> not neceſſarily, come under <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant, <hi>he was made of a woman, made under the Law;</hi> and becauſe he was not of neceſſity one with <hi>Adam,</hi> therefore he was not of neceſſity, but freely under his Covenant; but all mankind coming from <hi>Adam</hi> by a neceſſity of nature, becauſe they are <hi>naturally</hi> and <hi>neceſſarily</hi> one with him, they are therefore neceſſarily under his Covenant. And therefore Divines do ask, how a man becomes a ſinner, he cannot have ſin in his ſoul, becauſe it is created by God immediately pure and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and, <hi>creando infunditur,</hi> in the very act of creating it is infuſed; and ſin being only the act of a reaſonable creature, there cannot be ſin in this body, before the ſoul is infuſed: Now if there be no ſin in the Soul, then it cannot defile the body; and if there be no ſin in the body, how can that infect the ſoul? Our Divines do anſwer, That the ſoul is created by God, pure, and has no ſpot in it, and the body cannot have ſin in it actually, but, <gap reason="foreign">

The ſoul is infected by reaſon of its conjunction with the body, yet not ſo much by the action of the body on the ſoul, as by Gods ordination, who ſaid to</hi> Adam, <hi>in the day that thou ſinneſt,</hi> &amp;c. So that when a man becomes a man, he becomes one with the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and by his Union comes under his Covenant, and then the tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the curſe of his Covenant, takes place upon him: And therefore the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5, <hi>In him all ſinned, and by one judgment came upon all to condemnation.</hi> By one offence this Covenant was ſo broken, that it could never be made up again, but all men muſt periſh under it; therefore they all ſtood under it, as they were in him, and as they were from him ſucceſſively in their generations, and did receive their nature from him, ſo they were to be one with him; and being one with him, they come under his Covenant and his Curſe. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith, <hi>That he falling, all men did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of his fall.</hi> So for the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> it is only union with him that brings us under his Covenant. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11, <hi>God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his ſon; he that has the ſon has life:</hi> So that all the benefits of the Covenant are grounded upon our Union with him, who is the Prince of the Covenant, if you be <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed: How ſhall that be?<note place="margin">Gal. 3. laſt.</note> By being Chriſts; and then a man comes under <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant, and thereby is a Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that is only by being in Chriſt.

                  <p>So that if the Queſtion be, <hi>Is a man in Chriſt before he does believe?</hi> The anſwer is, His Union with Chriſt is before he doth believe; and the Soul is as meerly paſſive in union as in converſion: Chriſt muſt unite himſelf unto us, before we can unite our ſelves unto him; but the conſummation of this Union, is when we conſent unto Chriſt to take him for our own, (as the Wife does her Husband in marriage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) This receiving Act we have ſet forth, <hi>John</hi> 1.12, and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) It is the Perſon of Chriſt that is the primary object of Faith, and not his Benefits. The firſt promiſe to our firſt Parents was of his Perſon,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note> and not of his Benefits, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16, <hi>To Abraham and his ſeed were the promiſes made,</hi> &amp;c.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) There can be no Grace that can be the bond of Union with Chriſt, but Faith. God offers his Son, and that Grace that accepts of the offer, that makes the Union, is Faith: And no grace doth accept of the offer, but that which caries with it the conſent of the whole Soul, <hi>ex nolentibus volentes facit,</hi> it makes men that are unwilling, willing. If a Woman love a Man never ſo dearly,<note place="margin">Rev. 22.</note> yet if ſhe care not to make him her Husband, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come not one fleſh: Love is indeed, <hi>affectus unionis,</hi> an affection of union, and there is a moral union, or a union of friendſhip, but a myſtical union there is not, yea, cannot be by Love.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) All other graces are acted by Faith, they are the handmaids thereof. Faith works by love,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.5. 2 Cor. 3.18.</note> and therefore this is the grace that has to do with Chriſt immediately; Faith is the eyes of the Soul, that looks upon Chriſt in his Glory, and 'tis the mouth of the Soul that feeds upon Chriſt; there the nouriſhment is prepared for the body, and there is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributive Power in Faith, that gives every grace its portion. For this grace of Faith is the ſteward of the new man; and according to a mans faith, ſo it is with every grace; and herein lyes the excellency of Faith above all graces,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.20. Joh. 6.7.</note> not as it is a quality, but as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as appointed by Chriſt to be that grace of Union between Chriſt and us. And hence it is, that being the inſtrument of Union, it is that by which the grace of the Covenant is conveighed to us; as the action or motion of the mouth in ſpeaking and eating, is not one better than another of it ſelf: but as the one is the means of conveying nouriſhment unto the whole body, ſo the motion of the hand in working, is as excellent as that of receiving; but it is not ſo in reſpect of the inſtrumental nature of it, but only as it receives what is for the good and ſupport of the man: So here, other graces in themſelves are as excellent as Faith, but as God hath honoured Faith to have the immediate intercourſe with Chriſt, ſo as it is an inſtrument, it is more excellent than all other graces; as that which goes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to Chriſt, draws virtue from him, and ſupplies all other graces in the new man.</p>

(2) That which conforms a man to the Devil in contrariety to God,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.8.</note> that is ſin: <hi>he that committeth ſin, is of the Devil.</hi> Now this can become our ſin no otherwiſe than as <hi>Adam</hi> was a publick perſon, and ſtood by a Covenant for himſelf and his poſterity, and was by that Covenant to convey the ſame nature, and having tranſgreſſed his will, being wicked, it is a guilty, curſed, and forſaken nature, that is conveyed unto all mankind from him, they all ſinning in him; elſe corruption of nature might be their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but their ſin it could never be.</p>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52030:55" rendition="simple:additions"/> mercy and reconciliation, and in that there muſt be ſatisfaction to God, as well as ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of man; the ſin muſt be ſent to Hell, as well as the ſinner to Heaven: Now this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, man of himſelf can never give; it coſt more to redeem his Soul, than if he had offered thouſands of Rams, and ten thouſands of Rivers of Oyl, or his firſt-born for his tranſgreſſion, and the fruit of his Body for the ſin of his Soul, as <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.6, 7. But we cannot be redeemed by corruptible things; and therefore if God will have ſatisfaction an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable unto the wrong the creature has done him, it cannot be had from any creature; wherefore he finds out one that is able to bear it, one that is mighty, the man of his right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, that he ſhould be made ſin and become a curſe: And how doth the ſatisfaction that Chriſt gives to the Lord become ours? It can be no other way but by Union, and this union muſt be (1) <hi>Natural,</hi> he muſt take upon him our nature; for our debt was a debt of body and ſoul, to be offered as a ſacrifice unto the wrath of God: And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1, <hi>He that ſanctifies, and they that are ſanctified are both of one.</hi> He muſt take our nature, and in that nature ſuffer, as being one with us; for <hi>without ſhedding of blood there is no remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> (2) <hi>Voluntary</hi> and by conſent, he becoming our ſurety, and ſo under our Covenant, putting his name into our bond, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, and voluntary on our part, accepting of him as our ſurety, and conſenting to his Covenant, and the terms of the agreement; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Judge to whom the debt was due, and againſt whom the offence was committed.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. His ſtate is changed in Gods account, and the Lord looks upon him no more as the Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> and as growing upon the old root; though God has in his eternal Purpoſe cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen his elect in Chriſt, and given them to him before the world began, yet they are not actually in him, (according to the rules of the word) till they be converted, and ingrafted into him; and therefore they, as well as others, are dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, and are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God and without Chriſt in the World:<note place="margin">Rom. 4.16. Gal. 4.</note> But being once converted, <hi>Abraham</hi> is their Father, and <hi>Sarah</hi> is their Mother, and they are Children of the bondwoman no more.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Being in Chriſt, and their Covenant changed, they are under the Law and the rigour of it no more: For that requires perfect holineſs to juſtification, and life in a mans own perſon.<note place="margin">Rom. 10.5. Rom. 5.16, 17.</note> The righteouſneſs that is of the Law ſaith, <hi>This do, and thou ſhalt live:</hi> And therefore it's ſaid, <hi>By the offence of one man, death reigned,</hi> and not only ſo, but it's alſo, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="3">3.

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Before he had right to no promiſe, to no bleſſing by promiſe; but now he is become an heir of Promiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.28, <hi>We, as Iſaac, are children of the promiſe,</hi> &amp;c. There is a double right unto bleſſings, there is a right of <hi>providence,</hi> and of <hi>promiſe, a jus politicum, &amp; a jus evangelicum,</hi> a publick and evangelick right. An unregenerate man may have a right of Providence to Bleſſings, but it is only a man in Chriſt that has a right of Promiſe; and though he poſſeſſeth nothing, yet he has <hi>a jus haereditarum,</hi> an hereditary right, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary to all things: <hi>All things are yours, and you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A mans covenant being changed, God is reconciled; for the Covenant is a Covenant of reconciliation; ſo that the Lord does look on him as an enemy no more. A man ſtands in no relation unto God before his Covenant is changed, but as he is Gods creature; but when there is a tranſlation out of the firſt Covenant into the ſecond, a man is ſaid to be in God, and to dwell in God, and God in him. God is now Chriſts Father, and our
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52030:55"/> Father, his God and our God; whereas before they were enemies to God,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 1 1. Joh. 4.16. 2 Cor. 6.16.</note> and God to them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. A mans Covenant being changed, his ſufferings and ſervices are accepted as being Chriſts, for <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. it is fruit in him, and born by vertue of Union with him, that only is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20, ſays <hi>Paul, Nevertheleſs not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi>

And as his paſſive obedience after a ſort is ſaid not to be full, till all the obedience of the Saints is filled up, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.24. ſo it may be ſaid of his active obedience alſo; and all our ſufferings are Chriſts, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.13.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. All things work together for good unto him whoſe Covenant is changed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. Whereas to a man under the firſt Covenant, God does watch over him for evil, and every thing proves but an execution of the curſe of his Covenant; his bleſſings become curſes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the threatning, <hi>I will curſe your bleſſings;</hi> his Table is made a ſnare, and the Ordinances of God are curſed to him, and he is curſed in every thing that he puts his hand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And they look upon him with another eye than ever they did in time paſt: and this was the plot that God the Father delighted in before the World was, and that Chriſt was but the Father's ſervant in all this that he did; and <hi>that God was in Chriſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the world to himſelf;</hi> and that God was not averſe to the work as an angry Judge, but that Chriſt would bring ſouls to God; and the Father did love to have it ſo, and that all was the fruit of his own everlaſting love to ſinners before the world was; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16, <hi>That God ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son.</hi> And then all the offers of Chriſt, the calls and the invitations of God, and his compaſſionate intreaties that are in his Word, all theſe begin to take place upon the ſoul: <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth come to the waters, come and buy whoſoever will, let him come and take of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of life freely.</hi> That the price is already paid, and that the blood of Chriſt was ſhed to cleanſe ſinners: the Angels need it not, the Devils can have no benefit by it, it was given only for poor lapſed man; and therefore <hi>it is a faithful ſaying, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi> This is the drawing and the teaching of the Father,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.44.</note> not but that it is done by the Spirit alſo; but it is ſaid to be the work of the Father, becauſe the offer of Chriſt being Gods gift, is preſented unto the ſoul in the Fathers name, with a command from him to accept of him, and to believe in him. <hi>For this is his Commandment, that we believe in him whom he hath ſent, becauſe him has God the Father ſealed.</hi> And this took <hi>Luther</hi> ſo much, when he underſtood the righteouſneſs of God, that God intending to juſtifie the ungodly, had provided for him a righteouſneſs, which is therefore called, <hi>the righteouſneſs of God:</hi> and his ſoul was ſo taken with this diſcovery of the Love of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.17.</note> and the Grace of Chriſt, that he ſaith, <hi>I felt my ſelf preſently new-born, and ſeemed to my ſelf to have entred into Paradiſe.</hi>

There are two things in the words to be explained. (1) The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nterpreters. There are three Interpretations commonly given of it: [1] Some underſtand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t of the Moral Law, and the Law given to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, <hi>In the day thou eateſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thou ſhalt die.</hi> [2] By the hand-writing ſome of them ſay is meant the Ceremonial Law, and the whole Paedagogy of <hi>Moſes,</hi> conſiſting in Rites and Ordinances, by which men did acknowledg themſelves guilty of the breach of the Moral Law; for they were all of them open and publick confeſſions of ſin: and thus much doth <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> only underſtand by the hand-writing. [3] There is another Interpretation that I have met withal in <hi>Glaſſius,</hi> quoted alſo and hinted by <hi>Eraſmus, Chirographum eſt conſcientia arguens—&amp; condemnans, the hand-writing is the Conſcience accuſing and condemning;</hi> according to that Scripture, <hi>The ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Jacob is written with a pen of iron, and the point of a diamond:</hi> noting, that knowledg of ſin in a mans Conſcience, and a mans obligation unto wrath thereby. And all theſe I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be meant by the hand-writing in this place. [1] It muſt be underſtood of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>al Law, becauſe it is a conſolation given to the Gentiles as well as to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but they were never bound unto the Ceremonial Law. [2] It is to be underſtood of the Ceremonial <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aw as an appendix to the Moral Law; and both theſe had a power upon the Conſcience to condemn a man, and lay him as guilty before God; therefore with <hi>Aretius</hi> I ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, <hi>Quicquid nos apud Deum potuit reos peragere, quicquid nos damnat, &amp; quicquid Satan contra nos citare poteſt, hoc totum Chirographum eſſe, hoc eſt, teſtimonium peccati.</hi> So that the Moral Law of God enjoining us obedience, and the Ceremonial Law convincing us of ſin, and the conſcience of both theſe, are all meant by the hand-writing againſt us.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) The manner of the abolition, and that in ſeveral gradations. There are three ways of cancelling Bonds, and making them void: [1] <hi>Diſpunctione, by Diſpunction or Cancellation.</hi> [2] <hi>Laceratione, by Laceration.</hi> [3] <hi>Litura, by the ſponge blotting out, &amp;c.</hi> Now if the ſeal be taken off, and the Bond rent it is cancelled, but yet ſo that the characters of the writing remain; but now in blotting it out, which is here meant, it does not only cancel the Bond, but it does it ſo that nothing can be read againſt a man for time to come; and therefore it is as if it had never been; but the Bond remains though the hand-writing be bloted out: Therefore it is further added, <hi>he has taken it away,</hi> as well as blotted it out. But though it be taken away, it may be reſerved againſt a man to the day of judgment; no, it was <hi>rent</hi> in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and nailed to the Croſs of Chriſt, with the ſame nails that Chriſt himſelf was; ſo that the obligatory power of the Law, and the damnatory power of it is utterly aboliſhed by the death of Chriſt, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſaliter &amp; ſufficienter, univerſally and ſufficiently</hi> upon the Croſs; <hi>Particulariter &amp; efficaciter, particularly and efficaciouſly,</hi> when it is by the Spirit applied unto the Conſcience of a man, and ſpeaks pardon to him being juſtified by faith, ſo that he hath peace with God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thence <hi>to blot out the hand-writing</hi> is to take away the ſentence of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Wherefore the obſervation from hence is this.</p>
               <p>Doctrin. <hi>The firſt Covenant is perfectly and utterly aboliſhed by Chriſt to all that are in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. That the Law is taken away as a Covenant, has been ſhewed at large, in reſpect
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52030:58"/> of the main <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of it; namely, (1) That it remains not for <hi>Juſtification; For no man is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by the law in the ſight of God.</hi> Gal. 3.11, <hi>Chriſt is the end of the law for righteouſneſs.</hi> (2) Neither does the Law remain for condemnation; <hi>for he has redeemed us from the curſe of the law, and there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Nor (3) for Irritation, <hi>You are not under the law,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>therefore ſin ſhall not have dominion over you.</hi> Not under the Law forbidding ſin barely, and ſo provoking it, but under Grace healing a mans nature and ſtrengthning him againſt ſin. (4) Nor for <hi>Coaction; If you are led by the ſpirit you are not under the Law;</hi> that is, not under the Law as a ſlave under a Tyrant forcibly compelling, but you have a ſpirit of Sonſhip, which freely leads a man in all his ways, and carries him on with a free and a willing ſpirit. Thus the Law is aboliſhed as a Covenant with reſpect to all ends for which it can ſerve, whether principal or accidental.</p>
               <p>Theſe Particulars having been already largely opened, that which I would now chiefly ſpeak to in the opening of this Doctrine, is, <hi>the manner how the Law as a Covenant comes to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed;</hi> and this is by theſe ſteps.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt himſelf is made under the Law as a Covenant of Works: the Law that is here meant is not only the <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> which he did freely ſubject himſelf to being a <hi>Jew,</hi> but alſo and chiefly the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> to which he did ſubject himſelf as a man: for it's ſaid, <hi>He was made under the Law to redeem us, that were under it;</hi> therefore it muſt be underſtood of that Law under which we were, and from which Chriſts purpoſe was to redeem us, and that wherein our redemption does mainly lie. Now ſo all men are, in particular the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who were not under the Ceremonial Law; therefore it muſt be meant of the Moral Law, that he is ſaid,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.13.</note> 
                  <hi>to be made under the curſe of the Moral Law:</hi> now who-ever comes under the curſe muſt alſo ſo far come under the Covenant; therefore Chriſt being made under the Moral Law, as it is a Covenant came under the curſe of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt was made under the Law two ways, as he was man. (1) In reſpect of the debt to be paid. (2) In reference to the bond to be cancelled; for if man could have paid the debt of the Law of obedience, and undergone the curſe, yet he could never have taken off the bond of the Law; it would have lain upon him for ever, he would have been for ever under the Law. Now Chriſt muſt do both: (1) As our ſurety he paid the debt, the principal of which was obedience, ſo that the righteouſneſs of the Law is fulfilled in us to Juſtification; and by the Goſpel the Law is not made void but eſtabliſhed, and alſo the forfeiture taken off, he being made ſin, was alſo made a curſe for us. (2) That the Law might not ſtand in force againſt us for the time to come as a Covenant, therefore he has alſo cancelled the bond; being made under the Law as a Covenant of Works, he has taken away the Law as a Covenant unto all the Saints: <hi>He delivered us from ſin being made ſin for us, and from the curſe being made a curſe for us:</hi> and <hi>from the Law as a Covenant, by being made under the ſame Covenant.</hi> And ſo he did not only pay the debt, which we did owe to the Law as a rule of righteouſneſs; but alſo as it was a Covenant of Life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt was not under the Law naturally and neceſſarily as other men are, neither do I conceive that it is ſafe to ſay, that Chriſt as a man was ſubject to the Law for himſelf, and that he did owe obedience unto the Law; for though it be true, that Chriſt as man was a creature, and indeed every creature is ſubject unto the Law: yet looking upon Chriſt as God-man, and all the acts of Chriſt as <hi>actiones ſuppoſiti, actions of the Divine perſon;</hi> ſo they were above what the Law required; which is the ground of all his merit above the ſatisfaction of the Law; for the Law required perfect obedience of a man, but the Law did not require that it muſt be the obedience of him that was God and man: and therefore <hi>Luther</hi> has well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that he is the Lord of the Law, whence there is no Law againſt him; wherefore as he did freely and voluntarily take our nature, ſo he having taken it, did freely put his name in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our bond, come under our Covenant, that he might in every thing become a ſurety for us, having a right to redeem us being <hi>God</hi> our brother, and being bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us, as our ſurety, and being engaged with us in the ſame Covenant, and for us: and therefore as he is ſaid to be made fleſh, and to be made ſin, becauſe it was by his own voluntary ſubmiſſion; ſo he is ſaid to be made under the Law alſo, and by his coming under the Law he has both paid our debt, and cancelled our bond: and ſo the Law remains unto the Saints as a Covenant no more, and has no more dominion over a man as a Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He has fulfilled and ſatisfied for ever all that this Covenant required of us, he did it in our ſtead, and there is that full ſatisfaction given in him that the Law can never ask more of us for ever: for this cauſe we muſt as it is a Covenant be freed from it, and this is the reaſon given in the Text, <hi>He has taken it out of the way, and nailed it to his Croſs:</hi> that is, with the ſame nails that he was nailed with, the bond that bound us; that is, the Law as a Covenant was nailed alſo;<note place="margin">Rom. 7.4.</note> and this is <hi>to be dead to the Law by the body of Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>in the body of Chriſt;</hi> that is, we died in him, and he bore our ſins in his body on the Tree, and whatever Chriſt did
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52030:58"/> to the ſatisfaction of the Law in his humane nature, as our nature was aſſumed by him, it was for us, his righteouſneſs being imputed to us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſt has indeed fully ſatisfied the Law, but yet if the Law ſhould require perfect obedience of us alſo, then it muſt remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us as a Covenant of Works ſtill; but as Chriſt hath done it, ſo he hath done it for us, and it is done once for all, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for <hi>active obedience:</hi> though the Law require duty of us,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.10.</note> yet it is not unto Juſtification, and all our own obedience is in this to be lookt upon as a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy rag; and though we do here undergo many ſufferings, yet it is not for ſatisfaction, for he hath by one offering of himſelf for ever perfected them that he ſanctified: he is ſaid to remain a Prieſt,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.14. Heb. 3.7. Dan. 9.</note> and ſo doth his ſacrifice and oblation remain in the vertue and efficacy of it for ever, and therefore he is ſaid to bring in <hi>everlaſting righteouſneſs.</hi> So that if the Law look for ſatisfaction to the precept, it is perfected in him; and if it look for ſatisfaction to the curſe it is perfected in him, it can remain as a Covenant to us no more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it can as a Covenant exact nothing of us more: and therefore to all that are in Chriſt and ſtand under the Covenant of Grace, the Law requires their duties of him, and their ſufferings of him; ſo that the Law as a Covenant has nothing to do with them, but with Chriſt, who is ſtill under the ſame Covenant remaining their Surety and Prieſt for ever: and therefore in this victory of Chriſt over the Law as a Covenant, <hi>Luther</hi> makes the main glory of our deliverance to lye, and this was indeed the great end of Chriſts coming into the world. As for the other ends, <hi>Legem docere &amp; miracula facere,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Duplici jure Chriſtus le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem vicit proſtravit trucidávit; primo, ut Dei filius, legis Dominus; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundo, ut ſponſor noſter in noſtra per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſona: Quod tantundem eſt acſi nos ipſi viciſſemus quod à vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoria Chriſti noſtra eſt.

                  <hi>to teach the Law and do Miracles;</hi> theſe were but <hi>beneficia particularia, particular benefits;</hi> for his Diſciples did teach the ſame truths, and many things more than Chriſt did in his own perſon, and wrought as great Miracles as he; but his great end was, <hi>Legem vincere &amp; abolere, to overcome the Law, and as a Covenant to cancel it,</hi> becauſe he has fully ſatisfied it once for all: and therefore by way of ſatisfaction either in obedience or curſe, it can never require any thing of us to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

So for the Diſtinctions, to ſee God in Chriſt dividing between the guilt and ſtain of ſin; the guilt Chriſt will take upon himſelf by Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but he will not take the ſtain of ſin: to diſtinguiſh between the ſin and the ſinner, that the ſin ſhall be damned and the ſinner ſaved; God will take ſin off the ſinner, that there ſhould be a change of the perſon, but not of the righteouſneſs, that the guilt of all ſin ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away perfectly at once, but the ſtain of it blotted out by degrees. A mans Covenant is at once renewed, and his image but in part; ſo for God to diſtinguiſh between the Law as a rule, and the Law as a Covenant; and the Lord will utterly aboliſh it in the one reſpect, but not in the other. In all this is ſeen the Majeſty and Wiſdom of God: therefore as our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines uſe to ſay, If there had been a Council called of Men and Angels after the Fall, how a way might be found out to anſwer the different demands of the Attributes of God, Mercy inclining to ſpare the Creature as miſerable, and Juſtice requiring vengeance upon the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as ſinful; how Mercy and Juſtice may be ſatisfied, and God and Man be reconciled; how God ſatisfied, and the ſinner ſaved; how the ſin may go to Hell, and the ſinner to Heaven; how the Curſe of the Law may be executed, and yet the Grace of the Goſpel exerciſed towards
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52030:59"/> man, all the Creatures in Heaven and Earth could not have found out a way; ſo I may ſay in this particular, the Creature muſt not be <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>SECT. I.</hi> The ſubſervience of the firſt Covenant to the ſecond in general.</head>
                  <p n="1">§. 1. HAving largely opened to you the Doctrine of the firſt Covenant, we are come at laſt to conclude it in theſe three heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) A mans Tranſlation out of this Covenant, with the nature and neceſſity thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) The abolition of this Covenant unto all that are in Chriſt, that it is a writing cancelled.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) The ſubordination thereof unto the Goſpel and Covenant of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Of the two firſt we have formerly treated, and come now to ſpeak of the laſt, and ſo to conclude the Doctrine of the firſt Covenant.</p>
                  <p>There are in this Chapter two principal parts: (1) Here is a Doctrine confirmed. (2) Here are ſome Objections againſt it anſwered and cleared.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Here is a Doctrine confirmed, in which Satan had bewitched the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and they had fallen off from it, and that is <hi>Juſtification by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt alone, without the works of the Law:</hi> and this the Apoſtle proves by ſeveral arguments: (1) That which conveys the gifts and graces of the Spirit, by that a man is juſtified in the ſight of God: but that is not by the works of the Law, but by the Doctrine of the Goſpel, <hi>v.</hi> 2. (2) All men that are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed muſt be juſtified the ſame way that <hi>Abraham</hi> was; but <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by faith; <hi>for he believed God, and it was counted to him for righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 4.21, 22. Therefore they that are juſtified by faith only are the children of <hi>Abraham.</hi> (3) Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and bleſſedneſs are upon the ſame perſons, and that either to them that are of faith, or of the works of the Law; but it is not by the works of the Law, but by faith that they are bleſſed with faithful <hi>Abraham.</hi> (4) They that are under the curſe cannot receive Juſtification and Life from the Law; but they that are under the Law are under the curſe. (5) God has ſaid that the juſt ſhall live by faith; but the Law is not of faith, that is, it does not require faith, and propound that way of ſalvation and life, but it requires obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for it ſaith, <hi>He that does them ſhall live in them.</hi> (6) If a man do make a Covenant he does diſinable himſelf by his ſubſequent acts to break it, for by his own act he is bound: how much more then is the wiſe God engaged to keep his Covenant, who is not as man that he ſhould repent; therefore his acts are firm, and unchangeable like himſelf. So that the Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> being made 430 years before, an after-act in giving the Law cannot make it void.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:52030:59"/>2. Now the Objections follow: It will be ſaid that the way of Juſtification and Salvation by the Law, and by the promiſe, are directly contrary, or contradictory one to the other, the Law is not of ſaith; if the inheritance be by the Law, it is no more of promiſe; ſo that Juſtification and Salvation cannot be by them both, they cannot ſtand together, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhould ſeem that God did repent of his promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and diſanulled it, or elſe why would he for four hundred and thirty years after reveal the Law as a quite contrary way to Heaven, one by doing, and the other by believing? It ſhould ſeem therefore that the Law doth make the promiſe of God of none effect, or at leaſt, that God would have both ſtand together. For if a King ſhould at firſt make a Proclamation unto Rebels, that they ſhould live if they would accept of pardon, and then afterward ſhould publiſh a new one, that they that would live ſhould keep the Law; either a man would conclude, that the King had called in his former Proclamation, and made it null, or elſe would have them both ſtand together: and ſo it is here, God did at firſt promiſe righteouſneſs and life, to be had by believing, and afterwards he did publiſh a Law, requiring duty. Surely either the Lord did repent of the former, and ſo that Covenant is become of no effect, or elſe it ſeems he would have both joined together; and man ſhould be juſtified and ſaved, partly by doing, and partly by believing. Now to this objection the Apoſtle anſwers:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> (1) Gods intention in giving the Law, was not thereby to make the promiſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">(2) Gods intention was not to join the Law and the Promiſe together in the matter of Juſtification and life; becauſe they be quite croſs and contrary one to another; therefore <hi>by the righteouſneſs of the Law no man can be juſtified in the ſight of God:</hi> they do directly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap> thereunto.</p>
                  <p>And ſo much the Text does clearly manifeſt; (1) In that it's ſaid, <hi>the Law was added,</hi> was an appurtenance to ſomething elſe, and was not ſet up as that way alone by which men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e to attain righteouſneſs and life; now added by way of conjunction, it cannot be, they c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>not mix together and be <hi>concauſes</hi> of the ſame thing, and in the ſame kind; therefore it muſt be by way of ſubordination, the one as the principal, the other as the acceſſary or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional. (2) It is ſaid, <hi>that the Law was given in the hand of a Mediator,</hi> that is by the miniſtry of a Mediator. [1] <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Typical or the Notional Mediator; for he ſtood between God and the people in receiving of the Law,<note place="margin">Deut. 5.5.</note> and Chriſt was the real and univerſal Mediator. And hence it will appear that it was not ſet up alone as a Covenant of Works, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> was at firſt; for that was <hi>faedus amicitiae,</hi> a <hi>Covenant of friendſhip,</hi> when God and man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ere not at variance, when man ſtood before God in his own righteouſneſs, and there was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> difference nor variance between God and him; for a Mediator is not a Mediator of one, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erefore God giving it in the hand of a Mediator, doth clearly manifeſt, that he did not ſet it up as a Covenant alone. [2] The real Mediator was Chriſt, though <hi>Moſes</hi> Typical; and Chriſt did not by his Miniſtry bring in this Covenant of the Law, to make void the Covenant of Grace, which was the better Covenant, of which he was appointed Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, the Covenant that was made with him as the ſeed, and with all the Saints in him.<note place="margin">Ver. 16.</note> See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore theſe two muſt ſtand together, and the former cannot be diſanulled by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Now that I may be underſtood, we are to conſider that the Law is taken in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture two ways, as it was given by God upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> for a double end: (1) It is taken largely,<note place="margin">Jer. 31.33. 2 Cor. 3.3.</note> for the whole Doctrine delivered by God upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> with the Precepts and the Promiſes thereof; and ſo Grace is the Law written in the heart, it is the Epiſtle of Chriſt miniſtred by us. (2) It is taken ſtrictly, ſetting down an exact rule of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and promiſing life upon condition of perſonal and perfect obedience. And ſo the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſays,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.5, 6.</note> 
                     <hi>That the law is not of faith, the righteouſneſs of the law ſpeaketh in this manner, he that doth them ſhall live in them.</hi> Now if we take the Moral Law as given upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> in the firſt ſenſe, ſo it is a Covenant of Grace; but if we take it in the latter ſenſe, ſo it is a Covenant of Works; for the Lords intention in giving the Law was double, unto the carnal <hi>Jews</hi> to ſet forth to them the old Covenant which they had broken; and yet unto the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Jews</hi> it did darkly ſhadow and ſet forth unto them the Covenant of Grace made with Chriſt, and therefore it was not only delivered as a rule of righteouſneſs, but in the form and terms of a Covenant, <hi>this do and thou ſhalt live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">(1) In the firſt ſenſe, the Law given upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was a Covenant of Grace; for this Law does teach them, [1] That the Lord was their God, now ſince man ſinned God is the God of none but in Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> [2] This Law did ſet forth God to them as ſhewing mercy, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning iniquity, not viſiting iniquity, a God forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin; and there is no pardon but under a ſecond Covenant. [3] All the Sacrifices they were Types of Chriſt, and they were commanded in the ſecond Commandment, and they did all belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Covenant of Grace, and did ſhew that without ſhedding of blood there is no remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins, and God did ratifie this Covenant by blood which he ſprinkled upon the Book, and upon all the people; and all things under the Law were cleanſed and ſanctified by blood, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.23. therefore the Law in the adminiſtration of it unto them, was never intended by God to ſet forth a Covenant of Works, but it was a Covenant of Grace, and is uſually called a Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11. They ſtood to enter into Covenant with God, that he might eſtabliſh them to be a people to himſelf, and that he might be unto them a God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.17, 18, <hi>Thou haſt avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and he hath avouched thee to be his people.</hi> So that the Law was given by <hi>Moſes</hi> in Gods intention, plainly as a Covenant of Grace unto all thoſe that were able to look upon the intent of God therein. (2) But yet the Lords intention was alſo that it ſhould be a copy of the Covenant of Works, that God made with <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, which was never wholly blotted out of the mind of man; becauſe God would not have that wholly to periſh, and be forgotten; and therefore it was delivered after a ſort in the form of the Covenant of Works; and in this reſpect the Lord has made it a handmaid to the Goſpel, not that the Lord did intend it for a Covenant of Works, as if men ſhould attain righteouſneſs and life thereby, but as <hi>faedus ſubſerviens,</hi> a <hi>ſubſervient Covenant,</hi> as that which in this manner God would make uſe of, to advance the ends of the Goſpel, and the new Covenant. By all this you ſee that the Covenant, of which Circumciſion was a ſign and a ſeal, was not the Covenant of Works, but was the ſame that was made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe the Covenant was the ſame; Circumciſion was the ſeal of the righteouſneſs of Faith, and continued amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> in this Covenant; and that Covenant that binds to the obſervation of the Ceremonial, as well as the Moral Law, is not a Covenant of Works; but the Covenant made upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> did bind to the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law alſo: nor was the Covenant that God made with <hi>Moſes</hi> a Covenant of Works, for <hi>Moſes</hi> was (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.23.) a Believer, but <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.27. it is called the <hi>Covenant which I made with thee, and with all Iſrael when I ſtood before the Lord forty days;</hi> and he wrote the words of the Covenant, the ten Commandments.</p>
                  <p>But more particularly, the Lord did intend to make the Law given upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> a copy of the Covenant of Works, and to be materially and for ſubſtance the ſame that he did make with <hi>Adam,</hi> and with all mankind in him, in the ſtate of his integrity. 1. Death reigned from <hi>Adam</hi> till <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 5. Gen. 4. ult.</note> and therefore ſin came in, and we ſee that murder was a ſin in <hi>Cain,</hi> and publick worſhip was a duty. Men did begin to call upon the name of the Lord; ſo that the Law was in the World before <hi>Moſes;</hi> and it was not only written in the hearts of men,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.5. So <hi>Beza,</hi> Gen. 6.5.</note> but it was taught in the publick Miniſtery before <hi>Moſes;</hi> for <hi>Noah</hi> was the <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and in the Miniſtry of the Word, we know that the Spirit of God did ſtrive with men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. The word in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is <hi>to ſtrive in judgment,</hi> and by way of argument for conviction, ſo that the Law was given to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> as well as unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> and was for ſubſtance the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is given in the form of a Covenant of Works, with a <hi>this do, and thou ſhalt live;</hi> and ſo it was afterwards by Chriſt, and by the Prophets alſo preached: it was to the carnal <hi>Jews</hi> plainly a Covenant of Works, not in Gods intention, but by their own corruption, they going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.3.</note> and not ſubjecting themſelves to the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52030:60"/> righteouſneſs of God, it is ſet forth to them as a Covenant of Works. Now if the Lord will not give it as a Covenant, why does he not propound it as a rule, and lay down the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts without any ſuch terms of a Covenant, as if men ſhould attain life by it, when he did never intend to deliver it as a Covenant, in which men ſhould attain life by doing, but by believing? Thus the Lord did, that the terms of the firſt Covenant might be promulgated to the World, and that they that did ſtill deſire to be under the Law, might not plead ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the terms that God required in the Law, if they did expect life and happineſs thereby.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though I ſay it be for ſubſtance, and materially the ſame, yet in many circumſtances it differs from <hi>Adams</hi> Covenant; for this was a Covenant of ſuch promiſes and ſanctions an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it, as were not in the Covenant made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and a Covenant confirmed by blood, and thereby ſanctified, which <hi>Adams</hi> Covenant never had; and therefore though it did for ſubſtance agree, yet in many things there was a difference. This Covenant given unto <hi>Adam</hi> in a ſtate of Innocency, and for ſubſtance renewed upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> when it was by ſin wholly obliterated and blotted out, God has made a handmaid, or <hi>foedus ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viens,</hi> a <hi>Covenant ſubſervient</hi> to the Goſpel; it is <hi>Hagar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 4.23.</note> but the Covenant of Grace is <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah;</hi> and it is given in the hand of a Mediator, not only by <hi>Moſes</hi> but by Chriſt alſo; for Chriſt delivered the Law to them;<note place="margin">Act. 7.38.</note> 
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> was in the Wilderneſs with the Angel who ſpake to him in Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and with our fathers; and what Angel was it but Chriſt? he that ſaith, <hi>I am the God of Abraham,</hi> and he that was alſo tempted in the Wilderneſs; and the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>We are come to Jeſus, whoſe voice then ſhook the earth,</hi> in the giving of the Law,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.4. Heb. 12.25, 26.</note> it was his voice: and then by an enumeration of particulars, how the Lord has made every part of the Law as it is materially the firſt Covenant, a ſervant to the Goſpel, for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of ſin, <hi>the Law entred that the offence might abound;</hi> and the Apoſtle ſays,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.20.</note> 
                     <hi>I had not known ſin but by the Law:</hi> and alſo for the conviction of Conſcience, and the imputation of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.13. ſin is not imputed where there is no Law; and for the condemnation of ſin, that it may be a Schoolmaſter to bring the ſinner unto Chriſt, the avenger of blood,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.10.</note> a killing letter, and the miniſtration of death, to kill them and hew them; and it reſtrains ſin, and puts a bridle upon a man, and is a means of converſion; the curſe of the Law is ſanctified, and the threatnings ſweet, when the curſe is taken out, death has no ſting, the grave has no victory, and it is to all under the ſecond Covenant a rule, a companion and a counſellor.</p>
                  <p>The Law is to be conſidered, as I told you, two ways: (1) <hi>Largely,</hi> as containing all the Doctrine delivered upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and all things that may be reduced thereunto, even the whole Doctrine of <hi>Moſes;</hi> ſo it is diſtinguiſhed from the Prophets, the Law came by <hi>Moſes.</hi> (2) <hi>Strictly,</hi> for the precepts of the Moral Law,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.13. Joh. 1.17.</note> as holding forth a perfect rule of righteouſneſs, and as promiſing life upon the terms of perfect and perſonal obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereunto; and ſo the Apoſtle takes it in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. <hi>The righteouſneſs which is of the Law is thus deſcribed, The man that doth theſe things ſhall live in them.</hi> If we take the Law in the firſt ſenſe, it was a Covenant of Grace darkly revealed; for therein God did enter into Covenant with that Church and State, and unto all the Saints that were in Chriſt it was a Covenant of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Law was given upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> as a Covenant, cannot be denied; for the Scripture does plainly call it ſo, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.12, 13. <hi>The Lord ſpake unto you,</hi> ſays <hi>Moſes, out of the middle of the fire, and he declared unto you the Covenant, which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you to perform, even ten Commandments, and he writ them upon two tables of ſtone.</hi> And <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.2, 3. <hi>The Lord our God made a Covenant with us in Horeb; he made not this Covenant with our fathers, but with us, even with us, who are here alive this day; the Lord talked with you face to face in the Mount, out of the middle of the fire.</hi> It was the ſame Covenant that God before made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> for the ſubſtance of it; but when it is ſaid, <hi>not to be made with their fathers,</hi> it is to be underſtood only of the form and manner of the promulgation in that clear and glorious manner, and taking a Nation into Covenant with himſelf in a publick, eminent and ſolemn manner. And it had all the parts of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: there are two things make up a Covenant, (1) Direction of ſomething to be done by both parties, ſomething that they are bound unto; and ſo the Law is the rule of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. (2) There is a Sanction, which is the conſent and agreement of both parties, bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves each to other; and therein properly does the formality of a Covenant lye. Now they were both in this, here was a <hi>rule,</hi> and therefore they are ſaid to tranſgreſs the Covenant, that is the precept, or rule of the Covenant, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.2. and here was a <hi>ſanction,</hi> or a promiſe, <hi>you ſhall be my people:</hi> and all good things were promiſed them. And when the Lord does fulfill his promiſe, he is ſaid then <hi>to eſtabliſh his Covenant,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 8.18.</note> and <hi>to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his Covenant.</hi> So that the Law was given upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> not barely as a Law, but it was given alſo in a Covenant-way.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:52030:61"/>2. This Covenant was a Covenant of Grace. (1) That Covenant wherein God promiſes to be our God ſince the fall, is a Covenant of Grace; but ſo he doth in this, <hi>I am the Lord thy God.</hi> (2) That Covenant which does hold forth pardon of ſin, is a Covenant of Grace; but ſo does this ſet forth God as ſhewing mercy to thouſands, pardoning mercy; for it ſtands in oppoſition unto viſiting of iniquity. (3) Circumciſion was a ſeal of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. this was a ſeal of the Covenant upon Mount <hi>Sinai, He that is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed is a debter to the whole Law,</hi> Gal. 5.3, &amp;c. (4) That Covenant that was confirmed and ratified by blood, was a Covenant of Grace; but ſo was this Covenant that God made with <hi>Iſrael</hi> upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 24.3. See <hi>Buckley</hi> of the Covenant.</note> 
                     <hi>He took the book of the Covenant and read it in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the people, and they ſaid all, What the Lord has ſaid will we do. And he took the blood and ſprinkled it upon the people, and ſaid, Behold the blood of the Covenant which the Lord made with you.</hi> (5) That Covenant that binds to the obſervation of the Ceremonial Law, that is a Covenant of Grace; for the Ceremonies were all Types of Chriſt, and ſhadows of good things to come, and the body is Chriſt. The firſt Covenant had Ordinances of Divine ſervice,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.1.</note> and a worldly Sanctuary, (it is ſpoken of the Covenant made upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>) and they were all of them enjoined in the ſecond Commandment. (6) The Covenant made in the hand of a Mediator was not a Covenant of Works; for that was <hi>foedus amicitiae,</hi> a <hi>Covenant of friendſhip,</hi> that was made between God and man, he being perfect and needing no Mediator,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.19.</note> but this was given in the hand of a Mediator, and therefore it was of Grace.</p>
                  <p>But if we conſider the Law <hi>ſtrictly,</hi> ſo it contains the ſum of the Covenant of Works, which God did therefore reveal, becauſe it was even wholly obliterated, and blotted out of the mind of man; and therefore it was <hi>ſpeculum primitivae hominis juſtitiae,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>a glaſs of the primitive righteouſneſs of man.</hi> And unto all men out of Chriſt in an unregenerate ſtate, it remains as a Covenant of Works, binding them to perſonal and perfect obedience; if they hope to attain life. (1) The Moral Law is the ſame to the ſinner out of Chriſt that it was unto Chriſt the Surety; for what it was to the Surety, that it was to the ſinner; for he did put his name into our bond; only in us it was neceſſary, in him voluntary. But <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. the Law was unto Chriſt a Covenant of Works; therefore to every ſinner out of Chriſt it remains ſo. (2) That which teaches us Juſtification and life by doing, that is a Covenant of Works; but ſo does the Law ſtrictly taken; and it is therefore oppoſed unto the Goſpel; there is the righteouſneſs of the Law, and the righteouſneſs of the Goſpel. (3) The Curſe under which all unregenerate men are,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.20. Gal. 3.1, 2.</note> is the curſe of the Moral Law, but that is the curſe of the Covenant of Works; therefore the Moral Law is a Covenant of Works.<note place="margin">Gal. 3.13. Gal. 4.5. Gal. 4.23, 24.</note> (4) Therefore the Apoſtle makes it a diſtinct Covenant, from the Covenant of Grace. The Law thus taken ſtrictly as a copy of the Covenant that God made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and containing the ſum of the Covenant of Works, and being delivered in the form of this Covenant, this Covenant has the Lord made ſubſervient and ſubordinate unto the Covenant of Grace, as <hi>Hagar</hi> to <hi>Sarah.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. The great end of the Goſpel is to eſtabliſh the Earth, and to continue the World; for by ſin an utter deſtruction ſhould have come upon men and upon all the creatures for mans uſe, only there is a ſtop put upon Juſtice for a time, the change of the Covenant bringing in a change of the Government, and the Kingdom that was before the fall, adminiſtred by God immediately, is now committed into the hands of the Son, as he is God-man, our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. <hi>He has put all things in ſubjection under his feet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 49.8.</note> 
                     <hi>and he has given him as a Covenant to eſtabliſh the earth.</hi> And it is upon this ground that thoſe expreſſions are, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 93. <hi>The Lord reigns, he is clothed with Majeſty; the world is eſtabliſhed that it cannot be moved.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.1. <hi>The Lord reigns, let the earth rejoice.</hi> All this is ſpoken of the Kingdom of Chriſt and his Government that is committed to him by the Father under the ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and by vertue thereof ſince the fall. And this the Lord doth by the reſtraint of the Law two ways. (1) Hereby the luſts that are in a mans heart are kept under, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy not one another, for luſt is cruel; ſee it in the ſecond man that ever was in the world, and he that firſt actually brought murder into the world, and <hi>Nimrod</hi> a hunter of men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and as cruel to men as if they were beaſts; nay they are themſelves Beaſts, and have the cruelty of Beaſts, and men would be as the fiſhes of the Sea, the greater would devour the leſs, they have no King over them, and are acted by the ſpirit of the Devil, and his name is <hi>Abaddon</hi> the deſtroyer, his delight is wholly in deſtruction; and if the Lord did leave men to the violence of their luſts, and the impetuoſity of temptation, they would overflow as water over-running all banks and bounds, <hi>and blood would touch blood,</hi> where ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as ſome ſay by blood is meant murder,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 4.2.</note> or all manner of horrible wickedneſs (and ſo
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52030:66" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſome take it) ſo there is all manner of cruelty, and all manner of unnatural wickedneſs, even to the deſtroying of one another, as we ſee it in <hi>Egypt,</hi> every mans ſword ſhall be againſt his brother, and in the cruelty at the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Now how comes it to paſs that it is not ſo every where? Only from the reſtraint of the Law laid upon the ſpirits of men, and by this means the world is quieted, as <hi>Luther</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. hath obſerved, <hi>Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As there was a fulneſs of ſin when the Flood came upon the world, and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented the Lord that he had made man upon the earth: ſo there is a fulneſs of ſin when the World ſhall be burnt; and when all the wicked have filled up their meaſure, then ſhall the fire of Gods wrath be kindled upon the World, unto which it is reſerved. Only then when the World was drowned, becauſe there was a holy ſeed remaining upon the earth, the Lord did ſpare the earth for <hi>Noahs</hi> ſake, becauſe there was a bleſſing; but when all the Elect of God ſhall be tranſlated from this earth to Glory, then there ſhall be an utter deſtruction, and the earth ſhall be burnt up, at leaſt refined by fire. Now if there ſhould not be a reſtraint laid upon the luſts of men, every one that is now a Serpent would become a Dragon; and they that now ſin as men, would act like Devils, and the meaſure of mens luſts would be quickly fulfilled, and the end of the World would be ſuddenly haſtned. Now becauſe God has appointed a time that the World ſhall ſtand for Goſpel ends, and to ſhew forth the Grace of the Goſpel, that mercy may rejoice, and triumph over judgment, therefore he does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the luſts of men, that the fulneſs of the ſin of the World may be filled up by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It does exceedingly exalt the Goſpel, and the Grace thereof, that it does make ſuch a uſe of the Law, as is unto man fallen above the nature of the Law, and contrary to the uſe that ſin does make of the Law. (1) It is above the power of the Law unto man a ſinner; for the <hi>Law is become weak through the fleſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.4.</note> as we ſee they that know the Law, yet pour out themſelves to all exceſs of riot, and give themſelves over unto all manner of abominations. He that ſays, thou ſhalt not commit adultery, doth himſelf commit adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All this ſhews that the Law of it ſelf is weak: it can forbid ſin indeed, but it cannot reſtrain it; as it can require duty, but it cannot enable a man thereunto; but as <hi>Bernard</hi> has obſerved, <hi>It commands without grace, and it puniſhes without mercy.</hi> Reſtraining Grace in reſpect of ſin, and aſſiſting Grace in reſpect of duty comes not from the Law, but from the Spirit that is given in the Goſpel working with it. (2) It is contrary to the uſe that ſin makes of the Law, for ſin takes occaſion by the Commandment, and the Law is ſo far from being a means of reſtraining luſt, that by the Commandment corruptions are improved and increaſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.8, 11. the flood riſes the higher by the damm that is made againſt it, and there is this devilliſhneſs in ſin, that it does take occaſion by the Commandment to deceive a man, that is, it does work in a man a greater apprehenſion of the ſweetneſs of it, and a greater deſire to it, and longing after it; becauſe it is in the Commandment forbidden; and from the very prohibition does ariſe the ſtrength of the temptation; a man ſhould never have had his heart ſo much carried out after it, if the Lord had not forbidden it; and then a man ſays, <hi>Stollen waters are ſweet, and the bread of deceit is pleaſant.</hi> Now when Satan and ſin ſhall take occaſion by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment to improve corruption, and to draw it forth, that the Spirit of Chriſt in the Goſpel ſhould make a quite contrary uſe of it, to reſtrain it, and bind it up, it does much exalt the power of the Goſpel, and the ſpirit of the Goſpel which works with this Law.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Reſtraining Grace which the Spirit of God does work in a man by the Law, is of great uſe, and does mightily exalt the Grace of the Goſpel, in preſerving from open violences and immoralities. (1) In reference unto the Saints, that they are not deſtroyed, for they are ſheep in the midſt of wolves, their ſouls are amongſt lions, and therefore it is a wonder that they are not deſtroyed; it is God that lays a reſtraint upon their enemies luſt ſometimes, and they deſire it not, and ſometimes upon their acts, and they cannot effect it. <hi>Abimelechs</hi> luſt was reſtrained in reference to <hi>Abraham, I kept thee that thou ſhouldſt not touch her.</hi> And as to <hi>Laban,</hi> God laid a charge upon his ſpirit; and ſo it was with <hi>Herod</hi> in reference unto <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt:</hi> and it is by this reſtraint laid upon the hearts of wicked men, that the lives and liberties of the people of God are preſerved; and this is every day as great a miracle in ſome reſpect as to ſet bounds to the Sea, that it do not overflow, and as to ſtop the Lions mouths, or to hinder and reſtrain <hi>actum ſecundum, the ſecond act,</hi> of the Fire in the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Furnace, that it did not burn ſo much as the garments of the three Children:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52030:66" rendition="simple:additions"/> and that your peace and proſperity, and that the progreſs of the Goſpel is not interrupted, that the Devil does not caſt ſome of you into priſon, and ſeek your blood as in time paſt, it is not that he is not as truly the Deſtroyer ſtill as in times paſt, but the Lord reſtrains the luſts of men that he cannot act them and draw them forth as he has done formerly. (2) In reference unto wicked and ungodly men, that live in their ſins and periſh in them. Though it is true while the corrupt will prevails, and a mans enmity to God remains, ſo long is a man a ſinner before God in every thing, becauſe he is in his habitual frame of heart an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my unto all righteouſneſs.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Auſtins</hi> Epiſt. 144.</note> But it is a great common mercy that wicked men have by the Goſpel, that their luſts are not let out to the uttermoſt; and the greateſt judgment that men can be given over to, is to be given up to their own hearts luſts, delivered over unto the power of ſin, and to be acted by Satan to the higheſt, and the utmoſt, as <hi>Judas,</hi> the Devil entred into him, it was but a higher degree of acting of him in a way of wickedneſs. The reſtraint that is acted upon them leſſens the guilt, and does not ſpread ſo much in the defilement, the act of ſin does intend the habit. Nor is it ſo dangerous and infectious unto others; for ſinners in their actions are corrupters, and by their example taint many with evil ways and words; the more their reſtraints are, the leſs will their judgement and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be; and they ſhall have this fruit by it, which will be a great one hereafter. Seeing that all men are ſinners in <hi>Adam</hi> alike, and ſin in one man is as much improved as in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that all men are not alike ſinful in this life, and alike miſerable in the life to come, (for there be degrees of wrath;) and that all men do not ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and are not by Satan hurried on to the great Tranſgreſſion; it is no thanks to the man but merely to reſtraining Grace! So in <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.21. the young man that came to Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mark 10.21.</note> Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to love him;</hi> he was proud, and ſtood upon his own righteouſneſs, and he was covetous, and did part with Chriſt to reſerve to himſelf an Eſtate, and went away from him as being offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at his Doctrine, and never returned again; and yet it is ſaid that <hi>Chriſt loved him;</hi> what was there lovely in ſuch a man? Here Interpreters diſtinguiſh [1] of the act, [2] of the object. [1] Of the <hi>Act,</hi> they ſay there is a double love of Chriſt, ſo <hi>Cartwright;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Quia illi grata eſt humani generis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatio, ideo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que politicas virtutes ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re dicitur, Tenues &amp; pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latim per ſe evaneſcentes imaginis ſuae reliquias. <hi>Beza.</hi>
                     </note> a <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> and <hi>Divine;</hi> a Divine love, that is to Salvation; ſo he loves only the Saints; but there was a humane love, and ſo he loved his friends and kindred according to the fleſh, who yet did not believe in him. And ſome ſay there is a double love of God, and of Chriſt as God; there is a peculiar and a fatherly love, and this he bears only to his own people; but there is alſo a common love, whereby he loves whatever is of his own in any of the Creatures. So <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Calvin.</hi> But I ſhould rather call them the common works of the Spirit of Chriſt, diſpenſed unto unregenerate men under the Goſpel. [2] They diſtinguiſh of the <hi>Object,</hi> he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oved the remainder of his own Image, or rather the works of his own Spirit in him, though they were common, that he was preſerved unchangeable, <hi>in tanta morum corruptela, where there was ſuch a general and univerſal overſpreading of wickedneſs;</hi> and this was <hi>Donum Dei gratuitum naturale illam pravitatem non quidem immutantis, ſed in quibus illi placet paulatim re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primentis,</hi> Bernard. <hi>i. e.</hi> Not mortifying but reſtraining ſin. So that all this was grounded upon the reſtraining Grace the Lord did vouchſafe unto him in his younger years; for to be preſerved is a good thing, a great gift, it is a great mercy not to be tainted with the common corruption, and not to wallow in the common mire of the times, nor to be given over there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. (3) In reference unto godly men, before and after their converſion. [1] Before a mans converſion; ſo it was with <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>who was concerning the righteouſneſs of the Law blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi> and one that did not ſin againſt his Conſcience, even then when he perſecuted the Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 23.1. becauſe there is the greater guilt and horror upon a mans Conſcience, having ſo highly diſhonoured God, the greater bitterneſs to a man having inſnared and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted others by his example, and the greater matter of temptation, Satan repreſenting unto a man anew the ſweetneſs that a man has taſted in former ſins, and his former experience of it does exceedingly ſtrengthen the temptation, and make a mans heart to hanker the more earneſtly after them. [2] After converſion reſtraining Grace is a mercy; <hi>Keep back thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant from preſumptuous ſins,</hi> Pſal. 19.13. Alſo the word does ſignifie to reſtrain, or keep a man back, or with-hold him as with a bridle; the ſame word is uſed in <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. <hi>I with-held thee from touching her.</hi> And ſo <hi>David, Set a watch before the door of my lips.</hi> So that though luſt will be in a mans heart, and though it will ſometimes ariſe, and all the power of Grace cannot keep it under; yet to have it reſtrained, that it ſhall not break forth, and a man not to be hurried upon ſinful actions is a great mercy. After converſion for the luſt of Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be up in <hi>David,</hi> and he deſired her, and yet if he had been kept from the act, it had been a great mercy; and ſo in numbering the people his luſt was up, and to have been kept from the act would have been a great mercy; as we ſee it in the caſe of <hi>Nabal,</hi> his luſt was up, but how does <hi>David</hi> bleſs God, that it did not break forth into acts, but that the luſt was reſtrained before-hand: and ſo do all the Saints of God bleſs the Lord that ſometimes by his
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52030:67"/> Law, and ſometimes by afflictions, and by the admonitions of friends, or by the reproach of enemies, any luſt is kept within its bounds from breaking forth, or that there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of it in any meaſure, that a man doth not pour out himſelf upon it with greedineſs, that a man is not wicked in the higheſt degree, and that carnal fear doth not prevail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as it did upon <hi>Peter,</hi> and carnal love as it did upon <hi>Sampſon</hi> or <hi>Solomon,</hi> and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as it did upon <hi>Aſa, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. By the Goſpel luſt is ſubdued and mortified, and that is one great end of the Goſpel, <hi>That we ſhould deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts,</hi> Tit. 2.13, 14. <hi>And having theſe promiſes ſhould purifie our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. <hi>And he that has this hope does purifie himſelf even as God is pure.</hi> But the Spirit of God doth make uſe of the Law even to this end alſo, and the reſtraints thereof. There is a double way for the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of ſin: (1) By infuſing a new principle of Grace: (2) By reſtraining the old prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of ſin. (1) There muſt be a new principle of Grace infuſed, which will work out the contrary, and hinder the actings of it, the ſpirits luſting againſt the fleſh; <hi>We are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law but under Grace, therefore ſin ſhall not have dominion over you,</hi> Rom. 6.12. Not under the Law, ſtrengthning and irritating ſin, but under Grace ſubduing it, the Spirit of God-working in a man a new and another nature,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.6.</note> which is contrary unto ſin, and is like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that ſpirit of holineſs that works it: <hi>That which is born of the ſpirit is ſpirit,</hi> Joh. 3.6. <hi>and it cannot ſin, becauſe it is born of God.</hi> (2) There is a power of the ſame Spirit of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining and keeping under the luſts of men,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.13.</note> and thereby deſtroying them; <hi>With-hold from me preſumptuous ſins:</hi> in me they are, and I find in my ſelf a proneneſs to them, but keep them under. With-hold me from the actings of them, leſt they grow upon me, and get the dominion over me. As by the exerciſe of ſin it does increaſe, ſo by the reſtraining of it it does die, and is brought to nothing. It is as fire, if it be covered and have no vent, it will go out, and as Trees the more they grow above ground, the more they ſpread under ground, lop them continually that they grow not above, and they will by degrees wither and die; Grace doth grow by the actings of it, and ſo does ſin; and if a man ſhould have Grace in his heart, and yet never bring forth fruit, though it could not wholly die becauſe it it an immortal ſeed, upheld by the Spirit of Grace, yet it would never thrive. There is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way that the Devil takes to increaſe ſin in a wicked man: [1] He doth infuſe all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villiſhneſs into them that he can; the Devil entred into <hi>Judas,</hi> and put it into his heart to betray Chriſt; the wicked one toucheth them. [2] All that wickedneſs that is in them he does act and draw forth to the utmoſt. And there is a double way of the decay of Grace: (1) By ſtirring up and ſtrengthning the contrary principle of ſin. (2) By hindering Grace from acting in all things: and ſo though it be immortal ſeed, yet in the degrees of it it will decay: So it is here, the Spirit of God infuſing a new principle, and reſtraining and hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the actings of the old, by this means ſin dies by degrees, and the heart is weaned and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from it, and this is done by the Law.</p>

                  <p n="1">§. 1. WE have thus far conſidered the Law as it is in its ſubſervience to the Goſpel, as a glaſs diſcovering ſin, and as a bridle reſtraining it; now we come to the third Conſideration as it is a <hi>Rule</hi> to guide and direct a man in all the ways of obedience; and it is a Rule within, and a Rule without.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a Rule within, that is, the Spirit of God given by the Goſpel, or the ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, doth make uſe of the Law of God as an Inſtrument of Converſion, and ſo plants in a man a rule of holineſs and obedience in his own heart, a principle of conformity unto the will of God in all things. The Law indeed cannot do this of it ſelf, looked upon as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant alone, for ſo it is a dead letter, but as it is in the hand of the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledge of the Law is brought in by a ſecret and yet ſacred blaſt of the Spirit of God breaking in and blowing when he liſteth.</p>
                  <p>Now that the Law is an inſtrument in the hand of the Spirit for the converſion of ſouls, is plain: (1) Every part of the Word of God has a converting power, if the Spirit of God be pleaſed to concur with it; for every part of the Word of God is ſeed to beget, as well as milk and ſtrong meat to nouriſh; if any part of the Word of God be ingrafted in the heart, it will change the ſtock of what nature ſoever. (2) It is that which is attributed to the Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect converting the ſoul.</hi> Indeed there is ſome difference about the word <hi>converting;</hi> ſome ſay it is reviving or returning the ſoul when going down to the pit, <hi>thou ſayeſt Return again;</hi> but it is returning from ſin as well as ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,

(3) That is the promiſe of the new Covenant, <hi>I will put my Law into their hearts, and write it in their inward parts:</hi> for no man has by nature the Law of God in his heart; for the image of ſin, and the law of ſin is upon the heart of man by nature.<note place="margin">Gen. 6.5. Rom. 12.2.</note> [1] The Law of the Lord is by ſin blotted out of the hearts of men, that image of God and conformity unto his will is taken away which they had at firſt, and they have a new law the law of ſin there. [2] It is the Law put into the heart by the Spirit of God, that is the rule of all a mans inward obedience and conformity unto God. <hi>Adam</hi> had the Law written in his heart, not only a Law without, but inward diſpoſitions conformable to it within: and when man had blotted it out, God wrote it in tables of ſtone; but now he will put it into the hearts of men, ſo that they ſhall have an inward principle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the Law-rule without, and whatever he does require in the Law, ſomething within ſhall anſwer to it, but this Law is put in by the hand of God. [3] In Converſion God does put in the whole Law into the heart of man: what Law is it but the Moral Law? that which is a Rule of a mans way without, is the Rule of a mans heart within; and God will put it ſo therein that it ſhall never be blotted out again by ſin, for he will write it there, that it may remain, <hi>Litera ſcripta manet, &amp;c.</hi> but more particularly obſerve,</p>

                     <hi>When the Commandment came, &amp;c.</hi> it was a <hi>coming</hi> Commandment, not of his own fetching; it is therefore ſaid to be <hi>a voice crying behind us, This is the way walk in it:</hi> for every man by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath another law, the law of ſin, the law of his members, which ſtands in oppoſition to the law of his mind; the image he has upon him is the image of the Devil, and he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary diſpoſitions in his inward man unto God, and to the will of God in all things, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the word.<note place="margin">Rom. 12.2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That which is written there is the Moral Law:</hi> There are two great principal parts of a mans holineſs, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience;</hi> and becauſe the ground of Obedience is Faith, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is commonly called in Scripture the <hi>Obedience of Faith:</hi> and anſwerable unto theſe are the two great principal parts of the Word, there are the precepts of the Law, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Goſpel, and both theſe the Lord makes an ingrafted word: the foundation of a mans faith is the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and thereby a man is made <hi>partaker of the Divine nature;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4.</note> and the foundation of a mans obedience is the <hi>Precept;</hi> for in the regeneration we are renewed after the image of him that created it; therefore writing the Law in the heart, is a renewing of the image of God, which in <hi>Adam</hi> we had loſt, and that was a knowledge of the whole will of God, in whatever concerned Gods glory and his own duty; and he had an inward abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and diſpoſition of ſoul in all things to ſubmit himſelf thereunto with cheerfulneſs. So that in the fall, the Law of God that was written in our hearts, that was ſtamped upon us, and concreated with us, was utterly blotted out, and now the renewing of this Law in our inward man, is our regeneration, a putting the ſame diſpoſitions within us that were at firſt created with us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The finger that writes it is the Spirit; or the writer is Chriſt, and the ink is the Spirit, and the table is the heart;</hi> in which the Spirit works the habits of all Grace.<note place="margin">De ſpiritu &amp; litera, Cap. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Auſtin</hi> has decided it againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> that there muſt not only be freedom of will in men, and a teaching and a moral perſwaſion from God, which they hold; and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> ſince: but there muſt be an almighty work of the Spirit of God upon a man, creating in him a new nature, and putting into a man inward diſpoſitions anſwerable unto what the Law of God doth require, and that by a hand without, and ſo writing does ſignifie ſomething wrote in a man from without; and that I conceive to be the meaning of <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15.<note place="margin">Rom. 2.15.</note> 
                     <hi>The work of the Law written in their hearts;</hi> all the outward acts of obedience that they do, and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences accuſing or excuſing them, all thoſe are but the fruits of the work, the efficacy of the Law that is written in their hearts. We do not read that the Law is ſaid to be written in <hi>Adams</hi> heart, only God created man righteous; but <hi>writing</hi> notes rather an act from an extrinſecal hand. And therefore I ſhould rather conceive thoſe practic notions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. to be written in man by the common work of the Spirit of Chriſt, than to be left in him after the fall, not the droſs of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> but the foundation of the new, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that the Spirit of God has his works wrought in both; only in the one by a common hand, in the other by a ſaving work.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The thing that the Spirit of God doth write there is the whole Law:</hi> he doth write the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel and all the Promiſes thereof; <hi>he doth take of Chriſt and ſhew it unto you;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 16.</note> he reveals his glory to you, and the preciouſneſs of Goſpel-promiſes and priviledges; and a man does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, and is transformed into them. He does alſo ſhew a man the Law of God, and a man is transformed into the likeneſs thereof, even the whole Law, ſo that a man has reſpect
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52030:68"/> unto all the Commandments, there is an univerſal change; for there is not any part of the Law but it is written within him. Civil men may have ſomething of the Law put into their hearts as the Heathen had, and they may ſhew forth ſomething of the work of the efficacy of this Law in their hearts, and in their lives alſo, but they have but half the copy; but where the Spirit of God does write the Law ſavingly, he writes the whole Law.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>The Law is written in the heart, as it is written in a Propoſition:</hi> that which is written in the greateſt Letters in the Law, hath the greateſt Characters in a mans ſoul; and that which is moſt often repeated in the Law, that is moſt often repeated in the heart, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17.<note place="margin">Rom. 6.17.</note> 
                     <hi>There is a form of doctrine into which you were delivered as into a mould.</hi> Now in a thing caſt into a mould, as there is not the leaſt ſcratch in the mould but it will appear in the thing moulded thereby, ſo anſwerable unto the impreſſion in the mould will the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion be in the thing, and if it be deeper in the one, it will be deeper in the other: now to know God, and to fear him, to cleave unto the Lord Chriſt, and honour him, and obey him, theſe are the great things of the Law of God; wherefore for men to neglect theſe, and have their hearts much taken up though about truths, yet things of leſs conſequence, and lay out the whole intention of their ſpirits in theſe, to tythe mint and cummin, and to be all in meat and drink, and neglect true godlineſs and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, in which the Kingdom of God conſiſts mainly, this is an evil ſign, and an argument there is not the right moulding of the Law in the heart.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Laſtly, <hi>It notes an abiding and continuing of the Law there;</hi> as things written are for continuance, and for after times. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.1. <hi>The iniquity of Judah is written, with the pen of iron;</hi> that is, they are ſo ſet upon ſin, and ſo hardened in it, that there is little or no hope of their repentance; their ſin is written in the ſtains and the guilt of it upon their ſouls. So <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.3. we are exhorted, <hi>To write the Law upon the tables of our hearts;</hi> that is, by conſtant obſervation and meditation to fix them, and to imprint them. So that the Law is ſaid to be written in our hearts for continuance: the Law that was concreated with us in <hi>Adam,</hi> Satan has blotted out; but when the Spirit of God does write it there again, by the finger of God, ſurely it is that it may be never more obliterated, or blotted out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 11.30.</note>Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.30. <hi>Take my yoke upon you, for my yoke is eaſie:</hi> ſo that Chriſt ſuffers not his people to go without a yoke, he is not <gap reason="foreign">

Now writing the Law in the heart is a perfect conformity of a mans inward man unto the Law of God, and all duties that the Lord requires; and this is it that makes the yoke eaſie, becauſe it is become another nature, an inward principle; and what a man does ſo work from is not burdenſome; there is a <hi>potentia viſiva, a viſive power</hi> in the eye, therefore it is not weary of ſeeing; and there is a principle, a law of motion in the nature of the Sun, and therefore it is not weary of motion, becauſe it works from an inward principle. Men do evil with both hands earneſtly, and are never weary; the reaſon is, becauſe they work from an inward principle. And in this conformity unto the will of God, which is taking up the yoke, (1) There is <hi>obedientia voti, the obedience of deſire,</hi> when a man deſires to obey God in all things, and has a careful reſpect unto all the Commandments, and deſires to make his heart perfect with the Law of God. (2) <hi>Obedientia conformitatis, obedience of conformity,</hi> when a man does in ſome meaſure anſwer the Law of God in his actions, and in the workings of his inward man. (3) <hi>Obedientia reſignationis, obedience of reſignation,</hi> when a man can wholly give up himſelf to it, as to the perfect Law, with joy and delight, love the law and finds ſweetneſs in it, and ſees a goodneſs in whatever it requires, and gives up himſelf unto it as the perfect law of liberty, that wherein his happineſs lyes; this is that which makes the yoke eaſie, and the Commandment not grievous: and the ground of it is, becauſe the Law is written in his heart, and this is to ſerve Chriſt <hi>in the newneſs of the ſpirit, and not in the oldneſs of the letter,</hi> not barely to have a duty in the letter injoined, which is that which only prevails with other men to perform duty, whilſt all that is in their heart is againſt it, they do it, and yet hate the duty when done, and the Law that injoins it; but here is the Spirit of God renewing and working in a man ſuch diſpoſitions of heart, which anſwer the duties of the Law in all things; ſo that a man loves the duties, and the Law that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them, as ſetting him about a ſervice that he is pleaſed with; ſo that it is the Law that is the yoke of Chriſt, and it is writing it in his heart, that makes it an eaſie yoke. In putting the Law as a rule into a mans heart, the Spirit of God doth let a man ſee, (1) The Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the nature of God;<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.24.</note> for man was in this created after God, neither did the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52030:68"/> behold the Holineſs of God any other way than in the Law which doth forbid the leaſt blemiſh and defilement, all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit. (2) Herein a man ſees the glory that was ſtampt upon him in his creation, for his heart was nothing elſe but a perfect copy of this Law created in it; and in this conformity in his inward man to the Law of God, did this image principally if not wholly conſiſt. (3) This is a perfect reſemblance of the Holineſs that was in the humane nature of Chriſt, in whom the Law was fulfilled, for there was no ſin in him, <hi>He knew no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth, he was a lamb without ſpot or blemiſh;</hi> he was a living Law. (4) This is a perfect copy of that conformity unto God, that is in the Saints and ſouls of juſt men made perfect: <hi>When he ſhall appear we ſhall be like him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.2.</note> The law of his mind ſhall be perfected, and the law of the members wholly deſtroyed. Now we are conformable to the will of God but in ſome degrees; for that <hi>perfectio graduum, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of degrees,</hi> is to come; but the Spirit of God will go over our hearts and write more and more of this Law in us, till we be made in all things anſwerable thereunto. And in our conformity to the Law, (glory being nothing elſe but Grace perfected) ſhall our confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity unto God in Heaven be, where we ſhall not be like God in part, as here we are, but ſhall be wholly conformable to him, which is the perfection which we ſtrive for, and aſpire unto; and therefore the Scripture calls this our perfection, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13.9.</note> 
                     <hi>I long for your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> that is, a perfect writing of the Law in the heart, and this fits a man for Goſpel-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and the perfection hereof is the reward of the Goſpel; for the Law written in the heart is the foundation of all obedience unto the Law, and the perfect writing the Law in the heart is the higheſt reward of all the Promiſes, and all the obedience of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="2">§. 2. As the Law is a rule within, being planted there by the Spirit given in the ſecond Covenant, which does change a mans nature, and doth give a man inward diſpoſitions ſuitable thereunto, a law of the mind; ſo is the law a rule to guide and direct a man in his way, unto which all the Saints are to give heed, from which they are to learn their duties, and by which they are to judge of all the ways of God, and the ways of the world; the Law is added unto the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Fides efficit quod lex im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat.</note> as the rule to the hand of the workman; the rule is able to do nothing of it ſelf, it is a dead thing, it is the hand only that does the work, and if the hand can do nothing aright without the rule, the Law can work nothing being dead, without the Grace of the Goſpel, that only inabling a man to perform all acts of obedience, and yet the Grace of the Goſpel does inable a man to no other obedience but that of which the Law is the rule. Chriſt himſelf tells us, that his intention in coming was not to deſtroy the Law of God, or put an end to it, or make it void;<note place="margin">Mat. 5.17.</note> 
                     <hi>Think not that I come to deſtroy the Law or the Prophets,</hi> and interpreters of the Law. Now there are in the Law but three things to be conſidered, either it is for <hi>Juſtification,</hi> for <hi>Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> or for <hi>Direction.</hi> Now for <hi>Juſtification</hi> unto all that are in Chriſt, it is by Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed; no man is juſtified by the works of the Law, but by the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt: and for <hi>condemnation</hi> alſo; for he hath delivered us from the curſe of the Law, and was made a curſe for us. There remains now no other proper uſe of the Law but for <hi>Direction,</hi> as it is a rule; and therefore either Chriſt has deſtroyed it wholly, or elſe he will have it remain in this laſt ſenſe, and ſo the next <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. tells us, <hi>Heaven and earth ſhall ſooner paſs away,</hi> and the whole frame of this world fall to pieces, before the Law ſhall paſs away: therefore it doth remain for <hi>Direction</hi> unto the Saints unto the end of the world.

(2) In us, becauſe by the Grace of the Goſpel we do attain ſtrength in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to obey the Law, which is encreaſed more and more, till in our nature and actions we ſhall be made perfectly conformable unto the Law in Heaven, and ſo the righteouſneſs of the Law perfectly fulfilled in us, the Lord perfecting his good work that he has begun in the day of the Lord, ſo that the Law remains as a rule to Believers, being not aboliſhed but eſtabliſhed by the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Goſpel ſends us unto the Law as a rule of duty, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.30, 31. <hi>They have Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and the Prophets,</hi> the Law and the Expoſitions of the Law; and the Lord requires, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul,</hi> as well under the Goſpel as under the Law.

                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:52030:69"/> and for this cauſe Chriſt in his firſt Sermon frees it from its corrupt gloſſes, and interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Phariſees, and reſtores it unto its ſpiritual ſenſe, becauſe it was to be of a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al uſe in the Church of God; and it is ſo perfect a rule, that Chriſt added no new precept to it, but only interpreted and expounded the Law, and reſtored it unto its primitive and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal glory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſt has left us an example, and he is unto us not only the <hi>principle</hi> of holineſs, from whence it is derived,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.29.

Now the acts of Chriſt were of two ſorts, (1) Acts of <hi>Office,</hi> as he was a Mediator, by which he merited of God the Father pardon and acceptation for us, and ſo we cannot imitate him; but there are (2) acts of <hi>Moral obedience,</hi> which he did as our Mediator, and as our Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern; and in theſe we are to follow Chriſt unto this day: for his whole life was nothing elſe but a ſpiritual Commentary upon the Law of God; and herein we muſt be <hi>followers of all men as they follow Chriſt;</hi> becauſe there is a defect in all mens conformity to the Law, but ſo there was not in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 4.3.</note>4. So far as we come ſhort of it, even the beſt of the Saints, we ſin; for what is ſin but a tranſgreſſion of the Law? therefore to the Saints the Law is a rule of obedience, or elſe they ſhould never tranſgreſs it; and if a man would try and examine his ways, he muſt bring it to the rule; for it is a rule for examination. <hi>Adam</hi> was bound to the Law, and therefore his leaſt tranſgreſſion was a ſin; and we are bound as ſtrictly as <hi>Adam</hi> was, and ſo far as a juſtified perſon comes ſhort of univerſal obedience unto the whole Law, he ſins as well as <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of innocency; only in the Goſpel by the Mediation of Chriſt, the ſin is pardoned. Therefore under the Goſpel there is no other rule of obedience, but the Law of God, and every ſin is a tranſgreſſion thereof. Chriſt came into the world to be made a curſe for ſin, but not a cloak for it: the Saints are bound to the Law under the danger of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſin, though not under the danger of incurring death; and therefore ſin is <gap reason="foreign">

So that the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law and the Prophets did but ſpeak of Chriſt to come, and did vaniſh in <hi>John</hi>'s time, the Subſtance being come, the Shadows muſt fly away; but alſo all that manner of diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being more obſcure and leſs ſpiritual, and leſs powerful, all that did end, becauſe the Law and the Prophets did but ſpeak of Chriſt to come, but <hi>John</hi> of Chriſt already come, <hi>Behold the lamb of God, &amp;c.</hi> ſo much that word in the Original ſignifies.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. At the coming of Chriſt the Law and the Prophets were as it were taken away, not by abrogation, but by way of excellency, as when the Sun riſes, the Stars diſappear, and are darkned, and all mens eyes gaze on the Sun.

As there is a double end of the Goſpel, ſo there is of the Law. (1) That which was intended principally and by it ſelf, and that only was Salvation both in the Law and in the Goſpel, to advance the ends of the Goſpel. (2) There is an accidental end,<note place="margin">Intentio prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalis &amp; per ſe.</note> that which follows not from the nature of the thing but from the evil diſpoſition of the ſubject, and ſo unto all unregenerate men the Law doth diſcover their ſins, and make them out of meaſure ſinful; doth irritate and ſtir up their corruptions, and ſo doth heighten and increaſe them, and their condemnation for them, as the Goſpel doth: but yet we may ſay of the Law as Chriſt does of himſelf, <hi>That he came not into the world to condemn the world, but that the world by him might be ſaved:</hi> yet by accident he did condemn the world, being deſpiſed, and <hi>ſet for the falling as well as the riſing of many in Iſrael;</hi> but the proper and principal intent of his coming, was ſalvation and not damnation; ſo here. I may ſay of the Law, as it's ſaid of Chriſt, had there not been ſome ſouls that Chriſt did intend to life, he had never come into the world; ſo had there not been a ſeed unto whom the Law vvas to be a ſervant, the Lord had never given the Lavv, never renevved it, for there vvas condemnation enough in the vvorld before, and death enough before, and the vvrath of God did abound upon men, the Goſpel brings it not upon them, but leaves them under it; neither vvas it Gods intention in the Lavv, to bring them under further condemnation, though it does through their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption prove ſo; but had it not been for the ſeed, the Lavv had never been added as a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid to the Goſpel: ſo that all the uſe of the Lavv, and the diſcoveries of it to unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men, they do ovve to the Saints; for it vvas for their ſakes only that Chriſt did reveal it again to the vvorld.</p>

When the Law is ſo preached that men are ſtirred up to ſeek for Grace in another, and to obey him, and when the Grace of the Goſpel is thus offered, as that it inables a man to walk in the way of the precepts of the Law, this is indeed to preach the Goſpel; when a man does ſo publiſh the Grace thereof that he does alſo publiſh the Law as a ſervant thereunto.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Covenant of Works as made with man in his Creation, as violated by the Fall, and as cancelled in his Regeneration, and as ſubordinate and made ſubſervient to the Covenant of Grace, we have ſeen in the former Diſcourſe; and we now come to conſider the nature of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and better Covenant, which all the Saints in Heaven are ſaved by, which man can never break, and the righteouſneſs whereof ſin can never ſpend.</p>
                  <p>There are in Scripture four eminent publick perſons with whom this Covenant was made, which are ſet down in two inſtances in the Scripture: (1) With <hi>Adam,</hi> where it is very darkly repreſented. (2) With <hi>Noah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 3.15. Gen. 9.9.</note> and with his Sons, which is a branch of the Covenant of Grace, and is ſo brought in, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.9. <hi>This is the waters of Noah to me.</hi> (3) With <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to him was the cleareſt manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of it, who it may be was therefore called as a ſpecial term of honour <hi>the Friend of God,</hi> becauſe the Lord imparted ſecrets to him in a more evident familiar manner than he had done with the Saints of old, as a man does with his friend, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.73. it is his Oath that he ſware to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed were the Promiſes made;<note place="margin">Gal. 3.16.</note> and if you be Chriſts you are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed; and <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.22, 23, 24. <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family is made a type and a ſhadow of the two Covenants, and the durable generation of men under them. <hi>Abraham</hi> had two Sons, which things are an Allegory, they are the two Covenants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. <hi>ult.</hi> it is mercy unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and truth unto <hi>Jacob,</hi> becauſe in <hi>Abraham</hi> after a ſort the Promiſe and the Covenant did begin, and therefore it is mercy in making it, but it is truth in keeping of it. (4) With <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 89.3. <hi>I have made a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52030:73"/> with my choſen, I have ſworn unto David my ſervant.</hi> And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>I will make an everlaſting Covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of David;</hi> and <hi>Act.</hi> 13.34. you will find it again repeated; and therefore is Chriſt called the <hi>Son of David, and alſo David that ſhall be King over them.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 37.24. Hoſ. 3. ult. Act. 15.16.</note> The Tabernacle of <hi>David</hi> is ſaid to be raiſed up in the Primitive times; but there is a time coming that God will raiſe up the <hi>throne of David</hi> alſo, when that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſhall be fulfilled, <hi>I ſhall give him the Throne of his father David, of his Kingdom there ſhall be no end:</hi> and when that (<hi>Dan.</hi> 7.14.) ſhall be accompliſhed, <hi>He ſhall be brought unto the Antient of days, and ſhall receive a Kingdom,</hi> after the four perſecuting Monarchies ſhall be taken down, which we ſee not accompliſhed; when that Scripture <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.17. ſhall be fulfilled, <hi>That the Kingdoms of the Earth ſhall become the Kingdoms of the Lord.</hi> His they are now as he is <hi>the King of Nations,</hi> but they ſhall be ſo alſo as he is <hi>the King of Saints;</hi> and they ſhall ſubſcribe unto the Lord, and his name ſhall be called upon them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have made choice of this Scripture, as ſetting forth the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> or rather renewed which God had made fourteen years before,<note place="margin">Gen. 15.18.</note> but herein gave a more full expreſſion of his entring into Covenant with him. Wherein you may obſerve three things, (1) That there is a Covenant, the Lord will deal with <hi>Abraham</hi> in a Covenant way, the Lord will bring him into the bond of the Covenant.<note place="margin">Ezek. 20.37.</note> (2) The Author of this Covenant, <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the Lord God alſufficient; and therefore he doth not here call it <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant, but it is my Covenant. (3) The fountain from which in God this Covenant does flow, <hi>And I will make my Covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.</hi> This Covenant is a free gift, and an act meerly of free grace, and ſo much doth <hi>Abraham</hi> acknowledge immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately; for he falls upon his face to ſhew that he could never be thankful enough. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of a thankful ſoul is this, the more mercy it receives from God, and the more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it may have with God, and with the greater confidence he may come to him, with the greater reverence he does walk towards the Lord; for there is nothing that a gracious heart fears more than goodneſs, and he is loweſt in himſelf when the Lord exalts him high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt by his Grace. And this doth the Lord repeat three times, <hi>I will make a Covenant with thee, and my Covenant ſhall be with thee;</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant with thee; I will cauſe my Covenant to ariſe;</hi> that is, I will raiſe up ſuch a relation between me and thee, I will take thee into Covenant with my ſelf, and I will enter into Covenant with thee; and this he doth repeat ſo often, (as <hi>Mercer</hi> does obſerve) partly to confirm the Faith of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in the promiſed mercy, partly to ſet forth the greatneſs of the mercy, which no words were ſufficient to expreſs; alſo the repetition does ſtir up and awaken <hi>Abraham</hi> yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to conſider of the greatneſs of the mercy of God to him in it, and the greatneſs alſo of his engagement to God thereby. And from hence the firſt obſervation that I ſhall give you is from looking upon <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant as being the ſame with that God made with all the faithful, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>After man was fallen and had broken the firſt Covenant, the Lord out of his free Grace hath made with his people a ſecond Covenant, and a better Covenant.</hi> In the handling hereof are four things to be cleared: (1) <hi>The Perſon that makes the Covenant, who it is, Jehovah El-ſhaddai,</hi> (2) <hi>That God will after the fall, as well as before, deal with his Elect in a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-way.</hi> (3) <hi>The Lord hath the firſt and the chief hand in it, I will do it, I, even I;</hi> and therefore he doth every where call it my Covenant. (4) <hi>That the fountain of this Covenant is from Gods free Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Perſon</hi> that makes it, the Author of this Covenant; and here there are two things, (1) <hi>That all the perſons in the Trinity do enter into Covenant,</hi> and thereby bind themſelves to make themſelves over unto the Elect; and that will appear to you by theſe Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: (1) They have all of them the ſame nature and eſſence, the ſame will, and have all a hand in the ſame acts; as Creation is the act of them all, ſo they do all concur in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Covenant, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. (2) This is a <hi>Covenant of peace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,</hi> and the Son and the Spirit are as truly offended with the ſin of man, and had a hand in the firſt Covenant, and their authority was as truly deſpiſed in the firſt tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the authority of the Father; and a diſhonour was put upon them alſo, and therefore there was as much need that they ſhould be reconciled and enter into a Covenant with man for his Salvation,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bern.</hi> Ser. 1. de adventu Domini.</note> as God the Father. Yea ſome Divines conceive, that the firſt tranſgreſſion of Angels and men was chiefly againſt the Son; and ſome of our own Divines (as <hi>Reinolds</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. <hi>pag.</hi> 421.) ſay, <hi>That the firſt ſin of man was principally committed againſt the Son,</hi> it being an affectation of that which did properly belong to him, to be like unto God in Wiſdom; and alſo in this was ſown the ſeed of the unpardonable ſin which was to be the fatal ſin under the ſecond Covenant: and therefore as the mercy was the more glorious that they would undertake Offices in this Covenant for reconciliation, ſo there was the greater neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity that they ſhould alſo join and be taken into the Covenant. (3) If we conſider the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52030:73" rendition="simple:additions"/> that does tranſact this buſineſs and ſtrike up this Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> who though he did it as the Word of God in the name of all the perſons, yet it was the Son who did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſpeak in it, as <hi>Glaſſius</hi> expounds <hi>Job</hi> 33.3. the word is there, <hi>The breath of the Almighty;</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.1. where the ſame word is uſed, it is <hi>the ſhadow of the Almighty, &amp;c.</hi> (4) If we conſider that the Son ſpeaks of himſelf in Covenant as well as his Father; for it is by this Covenant that the Lord is the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe therein he did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſo to be: now <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.2, 6. the Angel of the Lord appeared unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Iſaac, &amp;c.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 7.30.</note> and the Angel of the Lord is by Scripture plainly proved to be God the Son; and it's generally (or for the moſt part) conſented unto by all Divines, ancient and modern;<note place="margin">Mal. 3.1.</note> and it may be that having the great hand in ſtriking up the Covenant, he is therefore called <hi>the Angel of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though all the perſons enter into Covenant with the Saints, yet the perſon that the Scripture ſays we do chiefly enter into Covenant with, and that hath the main and firſt hand therein, is <hi>God the Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is ſaid in Scripture to be a Covenant of peace and reconciliation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it doth ſuppoſe an enmity and a war. Now though ſin was committed againſt all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yet the ſuite againſt ſinners in Scripture does chiefly run in God the Father's name, as in all Societies there is uſually one in whoſe name all their ſuites are commenced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf;</hi> he ſpeaks <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of God the Father, who does reconcile us unto himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt; and therefore we are ſaid to be reconciled to God, and the work of the reconciliation of a ſinner Chriſt calls his Fathers buſineſs; and he is ſaid to be an Advocate with the Father, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. Sin is an offence to all the Perſons, they having all a hand in mans Creation, and all of them joining in giving man a Law, and entring into Covenant with him in his Creation, but in Scripture the ſuite againſt ſin is ſaid to run every where in the Fathers name, and our reconciliation is unto him; and therefore it is the Father that has the great hand in the Covenant as the perſon reconciled.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe in the Scripture the other Perſons have their peculiar Offices, which they have voluntarily undertaken in this Covenant to reconcile men unto God, and therefore both are ſaid to be ſent, which is a term of Office, the Father ſends the Son, and the Son from the Father ſends the Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. <hi>When the Comforter is come which I will ſend from the Father.</hi> Now <hi>Chriſt is the Mediator of the Covenant,</hi> Heb. 12.24. and the Spirit the <hi>ſeal of the Covenant,</hi> Epheſ. 1.13. the Covenant is the Covenant of Promiſe; and the Spirit of the Covenant is the Spirit of Promiſe, and the Perſon that tranſacts all from each Perſon within us in reference to this Covenant; as Chriſt does all with God without us in reference to this Covenant. Thence in Prayer we are ſaid chiefly to pray to God the Father; and Chriſt teacheth us to ſay, <hi>Our Father, &amp;c.</hi> not that we are not to pray to all the Perſons, but becauſe the other Perſons have undertaken their peculiar Offices in reference to the Prayers of the Saints; the Spirit within us as a ſpirit of ſupplication indites our Prayers, and ſtirs up affections anſwerable to our Petitions, and groans unutterable; and Chriſt as our High Prieſt receives this Incenſe, and offers it, and as the great Maſter of Requeſts tenders our Prayers unto the Father, and they are received out of the Angels hand; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Scripture we are chiefly directed to pray unto the Father: ſo though all the Perſons, Father, Son, and holy Spirit, do enter into Covenant with the Saints, yet the Covenant in Scripture is ſaid to be chiefly made with God the Father, becauſe of the Offices that the other Perſons have undertaken in the adminiſtration of this Covenant, and the Grace thereof.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It will appear by this, becauſe all things in this Covenant are from him, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſons in all the Offices that they undertake do it by his appointment, the original of all is in the Father.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The plot and the project was his to reconcile ſinners to himſelf by a ſecond Covenant, and all that the Son does therein is not his own will, but the will of him that ſent him; and it is by this will of the Father that we are ſanctified: the original and foundation of all the benefits that we have from Chriſt in this Covenant is from this will of the Father;<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> the Son can do nothing of himſelf, but what he ſees the Father do. The plot and platform was by him laid, and as (with reverence be it ſpoken) <hi>David</hi> ſaid, the platform of the building of the Temple was ſhewed unto him, and the deſign was his, though <hi>Solomon</hi> his Son built it; ſo it is here, the plot and the form was laid by the Father, but it was the Son that did build the Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Perſon with whom he would make this Covenant, he did deſign, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.6. <hi>Thine they were and thou gaveſt them me: And he ſhall give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52030:74" rendition="simple:additions"/> me.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 13.8. 2 Tim. 2.19.</note> And therefore there is Gods book of Life, and the Lambs book, and they do exactly anſwer one another, the latter being but a tranſcript only out of the former. <hi>The foundation of the Lord remains ſure, and hath this ſeal, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. He doth appoint how much Grace and how much Glory he will diſpenſe unto every one of them by this Covenant, the Lord has made Chriſt the Treaſurer, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.11. and as it were a Feoffee in truſt,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.</note> but Chriſt does not diſpenſe Grace unto all alike: there is a fulneſs of the age of the ſtature of Chriſt; but all Saints do not attain to the ſame ſtature in Grace, neither ſhall they in Glory, the difference is in the appointment of the Father; for in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing of Grace as well as in meriting of the ſame, Chriſt is but the Fathers ſervant, and does his will. <hi>To ſit at my right hand and at my left, is not mine to give, but it ſhall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It was the Father that employed Chriſt in this great work, to be the Mediator of this Covenant, he did not take it of himſelf, and of his own motion, but as the Father en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into Covenant, ſo he appoints the Mediator of the Covenant, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.8. <hi>He gives him as a Covenant,</hi> and he did call him to be a Prieſt; therefore you read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.18. <hi>My ſervant whom I have choſen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. He did confirm this Covenant by an Oath, and thereby made it unchangeable; or elſe it could never have been. And there is a double Oath, (1) An Oath to Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.4. making him a Prieſt by an Oath: (2) An Oath to all his federates, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He has delighted in this Covenant, and ſpent infinite thoughts upon it; and it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the <hi>pleaſure of the Lord.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 53.10.</note> 
                     <hi>How many are thy thoughts to us ward, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 40.5. it is the ſpeech of Chriſt unto his Father, as appears afterwards, <hi>If I ſhould ſpeak of thy thoughts unto us, they are more than can be expreſſed:</hi> and all theſe thoughts are in reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Covenant, and his thoughts of peace towards the Elect, which he delighted in from everlaſting. And by all this it will appear, that though all the perſons be in Covenant with the Saints under the ſecond Covenant, yet it is chiefly God the Father.</p>
                  <p n="2">§. 2. <hi>God will after the fall deal with his people in a Covenant-way:</hi> though mankind did prove unfaithful, and break the Covenant of their Creation, and ſo ſhould have periſhed for ever under the curſe of it, <hi>Covenant breaking being the great aggravation of all tranſgreſſion;</hi> and therefore though it was an act of grace and meer goodneſs before, yet now a man would have thought the Lord ſhould have tried man in a way of Covenant no more, but only have ruled him in a way of Soveraignty, and given him a command, and if he did not obey, to have taken him away as he ſaw good; but God will deal with man in a Covenant-way.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">Mic. 7. ult. Rom. 15.8.</note>1. The Lord will do it, thereby to make known his mercy and his truth, and he doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt both theſe in the Covenant; there is mercy in making the Covenant, and mercy infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely the more, becauſe it is now with a perfidious and ſinful people, whoſe hearts have not been ſtedfaſt with the Lord; and there is truth and faithfulneſs in keeping it, and there was no way for God to ſhew forth his faithfulneſs but this, by continuing a Covenant, and to be conſtant in it; from a mans converſion unto his glorification, for ſpiritual mercies, and for temporal,<note place="margin">Pſal. 111.9.</note> he is always mindful of his Covenant; he has commanded his Covenant for ever, that is, to ſtand faſt for ever; his Faithfulneſs is as the Mountains, and as the Ordinances of Heaven, and you may as ſoon change the one as the other: and this Faithfulneſs under the ſecond Covenant is ſo much the more ſeen, becauſe of our unfaithfulneſs unto him; when the unfaithfulneſs of man cannot make the faithfulneſs of God of none effect</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Lord will honour his Son as the ſecond <hi>Adam;</hi> and the glory of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was a Covenant and an Image, and ſo ſhall the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> be. And he muſt have a ſeed alſo to whom theſe ſhall be conveyed,<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.8. The word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                     <hi>In whom he ſhall ſee his ſeed, and prolong his days,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. and Chriſt is his Son in both generation and ſucceſſion, naturally, as they bear his Image, and legally as they ſtand under his Covenant, and the Lord will honour the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam</hi> as he did the firſt; in both theſe the Lord having made <hi>Adam</hi> the type of him that was to come.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That hereby the Lord might honour the Creature; the Covenant is the ſtaff of beauty, becauſe it is the great beauty and glory of any people that God hath taken them into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,<note place="margin">Zach. 11.10</note> ſpecially if we conſider the ſecond Covenant to be Matrimonial, and the Lord doth thereby betroth him unto himſelf in loving kindneſs, and mercy and faithfulneſs, as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.18. the great honour of the people of Iſrael, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.18. was, that they were a people pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar unto God; thence he is called the God of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> and this is the great honour of the Saints, which makes them more excellent than their neighbours, becauſe they have God ſo nigh them to be their God in Covenant.</p>

There is a love of reward which is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, when it is not this that is the only thing that lancheth a man forth in a duty, but only fills his ſails; but when it is mercenary love and has reſpect to nothing in the duty but the loaves, this is ſinful; and it is this Covenant that makes the yoke of Chriſt eaſie and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, having an eye to the exceeding great and precious promiſes, which engages a man to have reſpect to all the Commandments; for the Lord doth delight to allure men into ways of holineſs and duty.<note place="margin">Hoſ. 2.14.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the Lord will have it ſo: (1) That by the promiſes of this Covenant, he may ſanctifie a man, change his image, and make him partaker of the Divine nature, and that every one of them may carry the ſoul continually to Chriſt as ſtreams to the fountain,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4.</note> in whom they are Yea and Amen. (2) That this may be the ground of a working faith, and a lively hope, and a fervent prayer, all which are grounded only upon the promiſes of this Covenant; for had there not been a Covenant between God and us, there had been no place for faith, no ground for hope, and no room for the prayer of faith, which only is bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a promiſe. (3) Whatever is done in this Covenant it is God that has the firſt and chief hand therein, and we do not enter into Covenant with him, but he enters into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with us firſt; though the Covenant be mutual, yet it is called the Lords Covenant, as Chriſt faith unto his Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.16. <hi>You have not choſen me, but I have choſen you:</hi> they did chuſe Chriſt (as every believing ſoul doth) but the love firſt began on Chriſts part; and ſo it does alſo in this Covenant, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Not that we loved him, but he loved us, and me love him becauſe he loved us firſt:</hi> ſo we do not begin the Covenant with God, but the Lord doth begin with us; and the motion came from him alone. God the Father is not <hi>paſſive</hi> in it, but <hi>active,</hi> he was content that Chriſt ſhould reconcile us to him. As it was to <hi>David</hi> an acceptable ſervice of <hi>Joab</hi> in reconciling his Son <hi>Abſalom</hi> to him, becauſe his heart did run out to him; ſo God the Father is active in this work, <hi>he is in Chriſt reconciling the world;</hi> and all that Chriſt does is by the Fathers appointment; and he is his ſervant in it, and it is the pleaſure of the Lord, and he doth love to have it ſo; and had not he imployed Chriſt in this work, there had never been a reconciliation between God and man. As it is true by our Union with Chriſt we are joined to, or as the word ſignifies, <hi>glewed to the Lord;</hi> yet the Union doth begin on Chriſts part firſt, and Chriſt unites himſelf to us by the Spirit, before we can by our faith be united to him: ſo it is in the Covenant alſo, it does begin on Gods part; and as it was the Womans great diſhonour to be firſt in the tranſgreſſion, ſo it is the Lords great glory to be firſt in the reconciliation. And therefore when <hi>Adam,</hi> after his fall, ſtood trembling, and could expect nothing but a ſentence of condemnation, the Lord was pleaſed to reveal a new Covenant to him; for the Text ſaith, <hi>he was afraid and he hid himſelf:</hi> ſo unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> the motion of a Covenant was from the Lord, and not from <hi>Abraham.</hi> There is a Grace preceding which works Grace, and there is alſo a Grace co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating that acts Grace, but it is preventing Grace that is the firſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">§. 3. The main part of this Covenant is tranſacted by God without us, which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear if we conſider the particulars of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Purpoſe</hi> and intention of it, that is in himſelf, from his own will only; for all is done <hi>according to the good pleaſure of his will,</hi>

                     <hi>and he will have mercy on whom he will have mercy:</hi> ſo that the whole purpoſe and plot of it is in the boſom of God alone, and according to this plot all things are done in this Covenant. As in the Creation all things are done from an Idea in the mind of God, and according unto that platform,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.3. Joh. 1.18.</note> as the Temple was built ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the pattern, ſo in the Covenant alſo; and therefore Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to come from the

                  <p n="2">2. He entred into Covenant with Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> that he ſhould be the Mediator of the Covenant, and the perſon that ſhould do all the great works that he had intended in this Covenant:<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.9.</note> and therefore we read of a <hi>promiſe of eternal life made unto us before the world began;</hi> God did not content himſelf with a purpoſe, but he added thereto a Promiſe and Covenant to his Decree, which could not be unto us, becauſe we were not; therefore it muſt be unto one that did repreſent our perſons, and was lookt upon as in our ſtead; for a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe might be in himſelf, but a promiſe cannot be but unto another; and there was a glory and a poſterity that God did promiſe unto him in this Covenant, and that he would carry Chriſt through the work that he had to do,<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.</note> as appears afterwards: and therefore Chriſt ſays, <hi>He is my God, and the lot is fallen to me in a fair ground,</hi> which is the ſpeech of Chriſt; and therefore <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22. he ſays, <hi>The Lord poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way.</hi> The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that he made with Chriſt was the firſt of his going forth unto the Creature,<note place="margin">Prov. 8.30, 31.</note> and upon this were grounded thoſe true delights of Chriſt mentioned, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30, 31. <hi>And my delights were with the ſons of men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. By vertue of this Covenant are all thoſe Legal acts paſt in God. In the work of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption there are ſome acts <hi>ſpiritually natural,</hi> and they are acts of God within us, which do imply a real and phyſical change,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.6.</note> when our natures and principles are changed, and of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy are made holy: but there are alſo ſome Moral acts, and they are acts of God upon us; as if a man be a guilty perſon, or accuſed as ſuch, and there be an act of pardoning and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting, this is a Moral act, an act upon him; and if he be a ſick perſon, and there be a Phyſician to cure him, or blind, and his eyes be opened, this is a natural act in him; and if a man be a captive and he be made a free man by a ranſome paid, this is a change of his ſtate; the one is in <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and the other in <hi>Sanctification;</hi> the one is <hi>mutatio moralis,</hi> and the other <hi>naturalis.</hi> Now the main acts of God in this Covenant, and the main of the Covenant conſiſts in acts done without us and upon us; as by ſoveraign imputation he doth count our ſins Chriſts,<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.</note> and he makes to meet upon him the iniquities of us all; he died as the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and all the Elect died in him, and ſo his death took place for all the Elect that ever were, or ſhall be, by vertue of the Covenant of God, and the ſoveraign imputation of God immediately after the fall;<note place="margin">Rev. 13.8.</note> therefore is he ſaid, <hi>To be a Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world;</hi> that is, in reſpect of efficacy grounded upon the imputation of God, who <hi>can call things that are not as if they were;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 3.25.</note> and ſo all the ſins of the old world and the ancient Saints were pardoned the ſins that were paſt through the forbearance of God:<note place="margin">Tanquam in capite. 2 Cor. 5.21.</note> and ſo Chriſt roſe as a publick perſon, as a ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and he being juſtified all the Elect were juſtified, though there be an actual Juſtification when they do believe, and ſo with him we aſcend and ſit together with him in Heavenly places, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as he is made ſin for us, ſo we are made the righteouſneſs of God in him; as our ſins are laid upon him, ſo his righteouſneſs is imputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and truly accepted for us as our Surety. For the debt paid by a Surety is in the eſteem of the Law ſaid to be paid by the debter, and he for that cauſe is acquitted. And ſo it is in Adoption, <hi>Now we are the ſons of God,</hi> that is, God accepts us as Children and Sons, and becauſe we are Sons he has ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into our heart, we being by God counted members of Chriſt, and ſo by our Union with him we do partake with him in his filiation; and all theſe are acts of God upon us, but without us, and therefore the main benefits and acts of the Covenant are tranſacted by God without us; and that is as truly and as perfectly done now as ever it ſhall be.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is not a ſoul that is brought into this Covenant but it is by God the Father; he hath ſaid,<note place="margin">Ezek. 20.37. Joh. 8.44.</note> 
                     <hi>I will bring them into the bond of the Covenant.

It is only to this end, that they might be a people in Covenant with God; and all things that Chriſt doth, he doth as God the Fathers ſervant, to draw men into Covenant with him, that by Chriſt we ſhould come unto God. The expreſſion of <hi>drawing</hi> does ſet forth unto us its efficacy and certainty; and therefore <hi>drawing</hi> and <hi>coming</hi> are put together, to ſhew that man by nature is not willing but an enemy unto this Covenant, but <hi>ex <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

All things that are within us or performed by us, he has undertaken to work in us to will and to do; the beginning of it and the finiſhing of it belongs to him;<note place="margin">Phil. 1.6.</note> and here lyes the happineſs of the Saints, that in the Covenant God has undertaken both parts, and therefore the Covenant doth commonly run, <hi>I will be their God, ſo ſhall they be my people.</hi> He doth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for us, as well as for himſelf, he doth undertake that he will be a good husband, and you ſhall be a good wife; and in this lyes the great bleſſing of the ſecond Covenant, and the Grace thereof. It is true, that the <hi>paſſive</hi> part is ours; and there are ſome acts that do belong to us properly, we believe and we repent, but it is he that works in us to believe and repent of his good pleaſure. <hi>Nos agimus ſed acti; nos volumus, ſed ipſe facit ut velimus, We act but as acted by him; we will, but he makes us to will.</hi> Auſt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We are kept in the Covenant by him alone: he brings us within the bond of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and he doth alſo keep us there, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>I will put my Law in their hearts, and they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> And <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.7. <hi>I will hedge up their way, and will make a wall that they ſhall not find their paths. They ſhall follow after their lovers but they ſhall not overtake them;</hi> God will in mercy croſs them in ways of ſinning, and make all ways of ſin burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to them; and all is, that they may return to their former husband; though they have committed adultery againſt him, yet he ſaith unto them, <hi>Return you back-ſliding children and I will receive you; you have gone a whoring from me, yet return to me, and I will receive you.</hi> And <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.3. <hi>The Lord will buy them unto him again with fifteen pieces of ſilver;</hi> their baſe condition into which they were caſt ſhould be the ground of their returning unto God again, their former husband; it is the purchaſe that the Lord would give for them; diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and diſquiets, and diſappointments in ways of ſin doth the Lord give men to keep them in his Covenant.

                     <note place="margin">Mac. 24. Rev. 13.8.</note> they were deceived as many as were not writ in the Lambs book; a ſpecial hand of God is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them in their preſervation, and there is a power of God put forth for them, that keeps their hearts as with a garriſon; he that brought them into the Covenant, hath undertaken to keep them there.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Every renewal of the Covenant is from the Lord;<note place="margin">Gen. 2.15.</note> the Lord did make this Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and fourteen years after renews it.

                  <p n="3">3. That this Covenant ſhould be given unto ſome and not unto others: that when the Angels that fell were under the ſame curſe of the former Covenant with us, yet that the Lord ſhould not catch after the ſeed of Angels,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.16.</note> but of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and let them periſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Covenant, never give unto them an offer of another Covenant.

                  <p>I anſwer, No, Chriſt did not merit the Grace of the Covenant; there is a difference to be carefully put between the Covenant it ſelf, and the benefits and fruits of the Covenant; all the fruits of the Covenant are diſpenſed by Chriſt, and are part of his purchaſe, as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Grace, and Glory, the very being of a Church, God has purchaſed it with his own blood; but as for the Covenant it ſelf, it is that in which Chriſt is promiſed, and all the Merits of Chriſt, and all our acceptation with God through him; and it is part of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that God makes with us, <hi>I will give you my Son,</hi> and one of the grand promiſes thereof; and when he did reſolve to enter into Covenant with man, then Chriſt becomes his ſervant, and his choſen, he being to be the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and Perſon into whoſe hand all the tranſactions of this Covenant ſhould be committed.

                  <p n="2">2. There is free-grace in the Fathers qualification, and preparing and fitting of Chriſt for this great work: it is true, that Chriſt was God, and had a power equal with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore thought it no robbery to be ſo, yet the Scripture doth attribute all unto the free-grace of the Father. (1) It was God the Father that prepared him a body; he that doth give unto every one of us a body, as it pleaſed him, he alſo did give the Lord Chriſt a body, and did faſhion it according to his good pleaſure, even a humane nature;<note place="margin">Heb. 10.5.</note> the Holy Ghoſt did overſhadow the Virgin that ſhe ſhould conceive; it was a body that was given him by the Father. (2) There was Union from the Father; and therefore there is a grace of Union as to us: in Myſtical Union, it is the Father made up the match between us and Chriſt, and we are united unto him for ever; ſo in the Perſonal and Hypoſtatical Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is the Father that made up the match, and made the two Natures to become one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.35. <hi>That holy thing that is born ſhall be called the Son of God;</hi> for it was in obedience to the Father that he did come to take this body into Union; it is true, he did take the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but it was by the Fathers command,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.16. Heb. 10.7.</note> and in obedience to him, and therefore he ſays, <hi>A body haſt thou prepared me;</hi> and therefore he did take it upon himſelf, as he did his ſufferings, <hi>The cup that his Father gave him he did drink;</hi> and ſo in him dwelt the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is alſo the grace of Unction, God gave not the Spirit by meaſure unto him:<note place="margin">Joh. 3.34.</note> 
                     <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth whom God has anointed with the Holy Ghoſt, and with power. As it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Father in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell;</hi> as the Sun of Righteouſneſs, and as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of life: and this is not in him only as God but as Mediator; but all this is ſtill as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Father, acts of his free-grace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Aſſiſtance in this great work; it is true that Chriſt was God, and able to raiſe himſelf,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.11.</note> and did quicken himſelf, and did overcome death, and ſpoiled Principalities and Powers, and triumphed over them openly, but yet he doth aſcribe all this to the gracious aſſiſtance of God the Father; it is the Lord that made him a promiſe, <hi>that he ſhould go through with his work;</hi> and Chriſt doth ſtrengthen himſelf by exerciſing faith upon the Promiſes of God the Father, who promiſed,<note place="margin">Iſa. 42.4.</note>

                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 16.8, 9, 10.</note> 
                     <hi>therefore my heart is glad, and my fleſh ſhall reſt in hope; for thou will not leave my ſoul in Hell; [i. e.</hi> in the grave, under the power and condemnation of that ſin and wrath that now is upon me], <hi>nor ſuffer my body to ſee corruption; but thou wilt ſhew me the path of life, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. he ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens his faith by experience of his forefathers, <hi>Our Fathers truſted in thee and thou deliveredſt them.</hi> So that Chriſts aſſiſtance in all his managing of the work of the Covenant is wholly from the free-grace of God the Father; and therefore in all the buſineſs of it Chriſt had recourſe unto his Father by prayer continually.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Acceptance: It is true that Chriſt as his Perſon was in worth and value anſwerable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52030:77"/> all the Elect of God, and beyond them, ſo there was a worth and price in all that he did in his ſuffering anſwerable unto whatever the Law and Juſtice of God did require; God did abate him nothing, he payed the uttermoſt farthing, elſe there could not have been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction;<note place="margin">Iſa. 63.6.</note> for it muſt be <hi>redditio aequivalentis pro aequivalenti,</hi> it was a full ſatisfaction, God did abate him nothing in this, but God made our ſins to meet upon him, he did not abate him one ſin, and being made ſin he did not abate him any part of the curſe. And what mercies ſoever the Lord doth beſtow upon us, Chriſt hath paid a valuable price for them, becauſe his obedience did deſerve and did truly merit at the hand of God whatever the Lord ſhall beſtow upon us to eternity, either in Grace here, or Glory hereafter; it is indeed free unto us and a gift, but yet it is unto Chriſt a purchaſe; and therefore here indeed there is nothing of grace as it were, but all is of debt, that is, Chriſt did lay down ſomething an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable unto whatever God did either give, or forgive. But yet here is Grace in the Lords acceptance of all that Chriſt hath done and ſuffered for us, and the imputation thereof unto us, and that the Lord ſhould account this by a Soveraign imputation to be as done in our ſtead, and for us; for the Law did ſay, <hi>the ſoul that ſins ſhall die;</hi> it is Grace only that brings in the commutation of the Perſon, though there be no commutation of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs that was required of us,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.10.</note> it is meerly of Grace that the Lord has accepted of Chriſt for us; all the benefits of the Death of Chriſt, as Pardon of Sin, Reconciliation with God, Juſtification and Adoption, they do all depend upon this will of the Father: for had he not appointed this work, and thereby declared his acceptation, had not he accepted it, who was the Judge, we could never have had any benefit by it; and therefore it is by his will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone that all this is made over unto us, there was free-grace abundantly in his acceptation; <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 53.11. Joh. 6.38.</note> by the knowledge of him, and faith in him, (for of ſuch a knowledge it is meant.) <hi>I came not to do my own will, but the will of him that ſent me:</hi> the meaning is not as if Chriſt came unwillingly, but that his Fathers will was firſt in this work, and ſo much in it that the thing that Chriſt did principally aim at was to pleaſe his Father, and to do his will therein. Now becauſe Chriſts great aim was to do his Fathers will, and to pleaſe his Father, doing all by appointment from him, he knew he hath acceptance with him; for though Chriſt had paid the price, it was free with God to accept it or no.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. There is a reward that is given unto Chriſt for all the ſervices that he does perform; <hi>He hath a name above every name,</hi> Phil. 2.9, 10. and a <hi>ſeed,</hi> Iſa. 53. and a glory, <hi>He being ſet on the right hand of the Majeſty on high,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. <hi>ult.</hi> Angels and Principalities, and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers being made ſubject unto him: and this the Lord hath given him as a reward of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. I will not now ſpeak unto that Queſtion put by ſome Divines, <hi>Whether Chriſt did merit for himſelf?</hi> which our Divines do deny in this ſenſe, as being the great end why he did come into the world, to merit for his Elect-ones, becauſe the Scripture ſaith, <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son,</hi> Joh. 3.16. <hi>And to us a Child is born, to us a ſon is given,</hi> Iſa. 9.6. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>Herein was the love of Chriſt, that when we were enemies he died for us.</hi> And <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.19. <hi>For their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelf.</hi> But yet it cannot be denied, that the Lord did give glory unto Chriſt as that which he promiſed as a reward of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; only it was of Grace to appoint it, and of Grace to accept it, and ſo by conſequence of Grace to reward it.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And this will appear at the laſt day, that all that Chriſt hath and doth is from free-grace; becauſe the Kingdom that he hath received he muſt give up then unto God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24. He did receive a Kingdom at the beginning, and had a gracious mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of it when he did aſcend up into Heaven, <hi>All power is given him in Heaven and in Earth;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 7.14.</note> and when the Perſecuting Monarchies be taken down, there ſhall be given him a Kingdom which ſhall not be deſtroyed; but all this ſhall be given up to the Father at the laſt day. Not that Chriſt ſhall ceaſe as Mediator to be the Head of the Church, and to have an influence into them in glory, God doing all by a Head; for I conceive that the Myſtical U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is eternal, as well as the Hypoſtatical, and that a man under the Covenant of Grace ſhall never ſtand before God in his own righteouſneſs to eternity, but as he is juſtified by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt now, by a righteouſneſs imputed, ſo he ſhall ever be; for as here he is accepted of God for his Maſters Grace, ſo he ſhall hereafter enter into his Maſters joy: but Chriſt ſhall give up the Church, which is his Kingdom, and the preſent manner of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of it, and ſhall lay it all down, and make it appear before Men and Angels, that whatever he hath done, it has been as his Fathers ſervant to pleaſe him, and to do his will, and ſhall after the day of Judgement (which is the laſt act of his Kingly Office) give up his account to him, which ſhall be giving up of the Kingdom to God, that ſo <hi>God may be all in all,</hi> that is, have the glory, not only of all the glory of the Saints, but of all the glory of Chriſt alſo; and have his Grace honoured as the fountain of all: and it ſhall be manifeſted

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52030:78"/> ariſe <hi>de novo,</hi> that he knew not of before; and who is in his purpoſes unchangeable, and cannot repent; ſurely if he make a Covenant, it is ſure and ſtable, that no after-acts of his ſhall make it void and of none effect: but to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed was the Covenant thus made long before the Law was given; therefore the Law given afterward cannot make it void: and if the Covenant be the ſame, then the way of Juſtification and Bleſſedneſs muſt be ſtill the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Here are three things to be expounded: (1) <hi>What is meant by the Promiſes?</hi> (2) <hi>How Abraham is here to be conſidered in receiving of the Promiſes?</hi> (3) <hi>What is meant by Chriſt here, this one ſeed to whom the Promiſes were made?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. By Promiſes the whole Covenant of Grace is meant: He doth call it the <hi>Covenant</hi> in the former verſe, and the <hi>Promiſe</hi> in the ſingular number in the verſe following; and the reaſon is, becauſe the main of the Covenant doth conſiſt of Promiſes; they are many, Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this life and of the life to come, Promiſes abſolute and conditional, Promiſes of Grace and to Grace; and they are therefore called better Promiſes; and ſo becauſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Fathers, their good things were even wholly contained in Promiſes, as the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law was contained in Ordinances, and they ſaw nothing in the one but in the Type, and nothing in the other but in the Promiſes; they did ſalute them afar off, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing them died in the faith of them, but they never received the thing promiſed,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. Joh. 8.57.</note> only as <hi>Abraham deſired to ſee my days,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>and he ſaw it, and was glad.</hi> And it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called <hi>the promiſe,</hi> becauſe they are all one in Chriſt, being in him <hi>all yea and amen,</hi> as lines in a Center are one; follow any promiſe to its Original, as rivers unto the head and riſe of them, and they will all lead you unto Chriſt: and yet they are Promiſes in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves many, as the lines are in the Circumference, though but one in the Center, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth a quite different expreſſion, <hi>Strangers unto the Covenants of promiſe;</hi> he doth as it were make the promiſe but one for ſubſtance, and the Covenants many; the Covenants are many, becauſe of their manifold delivery, being ſeverally renewed; and yet in all theſe in ſeveral ages the promiſes the ſame, as if but one promiſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>How, and in what order, is Abraham to be conſidered in this Covenant, and in receiving this promiſe?</hi> In this Covenant <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtands as a publick perſon, as a common root,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> or as a common Parent unto all the faithful unto the worlds end, as one that did receive the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe not only for himſelf, but for all thoſe that ſhould after his example believe in Chriſt, and become his Children; and therefore he is ſaid to be the <hi>father of the faithful,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 4.16.</note> and they that do believe are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and alſo heirs of the Promiſe. For as <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, there are three ſorts of Fathers and of Sons, ſome are according to nature, and others are <hi>ſecundum Doctrinam, according to Doctrine;</hi> ſo <hi>Paul</hi> was father to <hi>Timothy,</hi> having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten him by the Goſpel; others <hi>ſecundum imitationem, according to imitation,</hi> as <hi>filii Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hami nos ſumus cujus fidem imitamur, we are Abrahams children if we imitate his faith.</hi> And this the Lord doth for a double end: (1) To put an honour upon his ſervant as a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his faith, and therefore he changed his name, calling him the <hi>Father of many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> as one that was the root and firſt in the Covenant, and they all coming in at ſecond hand, under <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant; and therefore <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.20. it is <hi>mercy to Abraham,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mic. 7.20.</note> 
                     <hi>and truth to Jacob;</hi> becauſe in <hi>Abraham</hi> after a ſort the Covenant did begin: not that to him the Covenant of Grace was firſt revealed, for it was made known unto <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> was juſtified by faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3. but becauſe unto <hi>Abraham</hi> was the cleareſt diſcovery of the Covenant, and the Lord did in the moſt ſolemn manner enter into Covenant with him, therefore it is mercy to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that being the foundation of making the Covenant, as his truth and faithfulneſs is of keeping the Covenant. (2) The Lord does it thereby to make <hi>Abraham</hi> as it were a Type of Chriſt, that it may be continued unto poſterity, that the way by which God intended to diſpenſe the Grace of the Covenant, was from one common head or root; as the firſt Covenant to the firſt <hi>Aam,</hi> and all his poſterity; ſo the ſecond Covenant with the ſecond <hi>Aam,</hi> of whom firſt <hi>Abraham,</hi> and afterwards <hi>David</hi> were the fulleſt Types and reſemblances. Thus that the Lord might honour <hi>Abraham</hi> his friend with the higheſt honour, as the root of all the Faithful, and that this manner of conveyance of the Grace of the Covenant from one common root might be made known, and thereby mans heart led unto Chriſt the root, and Prince of the Covenant; therefore it was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> as a publick perſon, and the father of us all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>What is meant by Chriſt here the ſeed of Abraham, not ſeeds as of many?</hi> Here Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters are divided. There is a twofold ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to which they have an eye, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto theſe two promiſes, <hi>In thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed,</hi> Gen. 22.18.<note place="margin">Chriſtus in individuo, Chriſtus in aggregato.</note> and <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>I will be a God unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee;</hi> and anſwerably unto theſe they obſerve in Scripture a twofold <hi>Chriſt, Chriſt Perſonal,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt Myſtical;</hi> ſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. the whole Church is called <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the ſufferings of the Church are

Here, ſome ſay, is to be underſtood <hi>Chriſt perſonal,</hi> for two reaſons: (1) The perſon to whom the promiſe is made is the ſame in whom all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but this is by <hi>Abraham</hi> in reference to this ſeed. It's true, all the faithful as they are the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> they are bleſſed with faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> but they are not that ſeed in whom all the Nations of the world ſhall be bleſſed,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Bulkley</hi> of the Goſpel-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. <hi>p.</hi> 37.</note> in order unto <hi>Abraham;</hi> but this cannot be Chriſt Perſonal, for he has not a right unto the Promiſe from <hi>Abraham,</hi> but <hi>Abraham</hi> from him, and therefore it muſt be underſtood of Chriſt Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, who are to look upon <hi>Abraham</hi> as the root, and themſelves as branches. (2) They argue from the Apoſtles ſcope in this place, which is to prove that all the Faithful are juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by faith, in the ſame way that <hi>Abraham</hi> was: for the Covenant was not only made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> but with his ſeed alſo, and that ſeed is not many; for then the Covenants muſt be many; but whether they be <hi>Jews</hi> or Gentiles, if they do believe, they are all of them the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> one ſeed, and therefore come under the ſame Covenant, and muſt expect juſtification and life the ſame way, by vertue of the ſame Covenant. The reaſon ſeems very plain on both ſides, and I do conceive that they have the truth between them, and that it is to be underſtood both of Chriſt <hi>Perſonal</hi> primarily and principally, and afterward Chriſt <hi>Myſtical,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gomar.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Perkins.</hi>
                     </note> and ſo many Divines do expound it: and that the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> was confirmed unto Chriſt and that herein the ſtrength and ſtability of the Covenant ſtands, this is plain in the next verſe; and that it is in this ſeed that <hi>Abraham</hi> is bleſſed as well as all the Nations of the Earth; for he is the root of all the Patriarchs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.5. called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the root of <hi>David;</hi> he did come out of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> but yet he is the root alſo upon which <hi>David</hi> did grow; and we ſee that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by faith, and that was in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſeed,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.15.</note> called the ſeed of the woman (before he was called the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi>) and therefore it was in him that the Covenant vouchſafed to <hi>Abraham</hi> was confirmed and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. And for the order here no man will wonder if he look upon Chriſt as the Son of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> that he is ſet firſt with him and his ſeed, it is no more derogatory from Chriſt than that the mercies of the ſecond Covenant ſhould be called,<note place="margin">Iſa. 55.3. Pſal. 89.4. Luk. 1.32. Hoſ. 3.5.</note> 
                     <hi>The ſure mercies of David,</hi> or that the Covenant ſhould be made with <hi>David,</hi> and that he ſhould ſit upon the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> and ſucceed <hi>David</hi> in his Kingdom, and that he ſhould plead the Promiſes made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fathers, as if he did come under their Covenant, in the actual miniſtration of it, they being types of him, though he himſelf was the root and foundation of the Covenant, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 22.4.</note> 
                     <hi>Our Fathers truſted in thee, and thou deliveredſt them.</hi> As the Son of <hi>David</hi> he is ſaid after a ſort to enter upon <hi>Davids</hi> Kingdom, as the Son of <hi>Abraham</hi> upon his Covenant, and yet he is the root and foundation of the one as well as of the other. From all this it is plain here are three ſorts of Perſons with whom the Covenant is made: (1) Here is Chriſt <hi>Perſonally,</hi> with whom <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant is confirmed, the ſeed in which <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed. (2) Here is <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the Faithful. (3) Here is another ſort of ſeed, the <hi>faithful,</hi> and they are taken into the Covenant at ſecond hand: and from hence we do learn that the Covenant of Grace is made with Chriſt Perſonal the Mediator;<note place="margin">Gal. 3.3.</note> and then there being none in this Covenant but they that are one with him, they that are Chriſts are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, therefore the Covenant is made with all the Faithful in the ſecond place, as they are one with him, and with their ſeed.</p>
                  <p n="2">§. 2. Thus the firſt perſon with whom the Covenant of Grace is made, is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as God and man, and ſo the obſervation is this:</p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt as the ſecond Adam is that perſon with whom primarily and principally the Covenant of Grace was made, and to whom primarily and principally all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of that Covenant belong.</hi> This Covenant made with Chriſt we ſee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.8. As the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was the head of the firſt Covenant, ſo whatever is done in the ſecond Covenant it is by Chriſt,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.9.</note> and therefore he is ſaid to be <hi>our Covenant,</hi> as he is <hi>our peace;</hi> for he is <hi>Caput
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52030:79"/> Confoederatorum, the Head of the Confederates,</hi> not only by purpoſe in himſelf,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.2. 2 Tim. 1.9. Rev. 13.8.</note> but by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; there was Grace given us before the world began, it could not be unto us in our own Perſons before we were, and therefore it muſt be unto another as one that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took for us: and therefore we read, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. there was the <hi>Lambs book from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world:</hi> the Lord gave the ſouls unto Chriſt that he ſhould ſave, and Chriſt did write them down in his book as the perſons that God the Father had given him, and he had engaged to ſave; and this Covenant of Chriſt took place immediately after the Fall, and by vertue thereof God pardoned all the ſins of the ancient Saints, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. Chriſt did keep the thing that he did Covenant, to pay the debt that we owed to God, and all was <hi>viz.</hi> tranſacted by God the Father and Chriſt in a Covenant way: ſo that as now Chriſt truſts God for the performance of his Promiſe, ſo God did truſt Chriſt for the payment of his Debt; and therefore as the firſt Covenant was made with <hi>Adam</hi> Gods friend, ſo the ſecond Covenant was made with <hi>Adam</hi> Gods fellow; and I know not what elſe can be the meaning of <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22. <hi>To be ſet up or anointed as a King before the foundations of the Earth were laid.</hi> The ſame word is in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6. in reference to the Covenant, and the tranſactions that were between the Father and the Son before the World was. And this Covenant made between God and Chriſt hath two parts. (1) There is a Covenant with Chriſt as Mediator, <hi>ratione muneris, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his Office.</hi> (2) There is a Covenant made with Chriſt as the Churches Head, <hi>ratione Corporis, as his body;</hi> there is a Covenant made with him alone, though it was made for us, yet not with us; and there is a Covenant made with him, and with us in him, but with him primarily as the Head, and with us as the Members, as we come under his Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is a Covenant made with Chriſt Perſonal, <hi>Ratione muneris, in reſpect of his Office,</hi> as Mediator, that he hath undertaken; and this we ſhall ſee is plain. Here is God the Father entring into Covenant with Chriſt, he did lay upon him an Office, and he made him a promiſe thereupon; an Office he did ordain him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18.<note place="margin">Iſa. 42.1.

                  <p>And all theſe Promiſes the Lord confirmed by Oath to him.

(1) Chriſt does accept this Office that he may be the Fathers ſervant in it; and he does promiſe obedience unto his Fathers will; he did not glorifie himſelf in it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18.<note place="margin">Pſal. 4.7, 8.

(4) Anſwerable unto this Covenant Chriſt doth follow God with Prayers, that he may have the glory and the victory that the Lord promiſed him, and that in the Covenant

                  <p n="2">2. God is ſaid in Scripture to be the God of Chriſt; and Chriſt calls him not only his Father,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.</note> but his God alſo, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? He ſhall cry unto me, Thou art my Father, and my God.</hi> Now one Perſon cannot be ſaid to be the God of another; the Father is not the God of the Son, but the Father, for the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is equal in them both, and the Son thinks it no robbery ſo to be: therefore as he is the Son,<note place="margin">Joh. 20.17.</note> the Father cannot be called his God, but as he is Mediator; and ſo that grand Promiſe, <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> is made to Chriſt, as well as unto us. Now how comes it to paſs that God is the God of Chriſt? it is by <hi>Donation</hi> and <hi>Stipulation;</hi> the Lord beſtows himſelf upon him, and he doth accept of him to be his God in Covenant: and ſo, though as he is the ſecond Perſon, God is his Father; yet as he is the Mediator, and he comes into Covenant with him, ſo he is his God, and it is a new Covenant-right to God that Chriſt has taken as Mediator:</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We have a Seal ſet unto this Covenant made with Chriſt: Sacraments are ſealing Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.11.</note> and the great end of Baptiſm is ſealing, <hi>He received the ſign of Circumciſion a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of Faith;</hi> a ſeal of the righteouſneſs which was his by Faith, and he is accepted of God thereby; and what <hi>Abraham</hi> had by Circumciſion, the Saints have by Baptiſm.<note place="margin">Col 2.11, 12.

                  <p n="4">4. The Scripture doth hold forth this Covenant unto us in the terms of it; Chriſt doth publiſh his commiſſion unto the world,<note place="margin">Iſa. 49.1, 2.</note> how the <hi>Lord had called and fitted him from the womb, made his mouth as a ſharp ſword, in the ſhadow of his hand he hid me, and made me a poliſhed ſhaft, and ſaid Thou art my ſervant in whom I will be glorified.</hi> And what is the ſervice that the Lord called him to? to bring <hi>Jacob</hi> to him.

                  <p n="2">2dly. <hi>Why muſt ſuch a Covenant paſs between the Father and the Son in ſuch a ſolemn manner?</hi> The Lord will deal with Chriſt in this great work in a Covenant way; 1. Becauſe he will have Chriſt to be propounded unto the World as the ſecond Adam: For God did intend to bring all the elect under one head, that <hi>as the offence was by one, ſo the free gift by grace might alſo be ſo; Rom.</hi> 5. God did intend that all man-kind ſhould come under a double head, and ſo be preſented unto him in the laſt Judgment, the firſt and ſecond <hi>Adam;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord ſpeaks as if there were but two men in the World, the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.47.</note> and the ſecond; and the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> muſt be the Type of him that was to come: therefore as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had a Covenant made with him, and an Image ſtampt upon him for himſelf and for all his poſterity, ſo muſt the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> alſo have; and therefore he muſt be the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> by Covenant made with him as a publick perſon, and as a repreſentative head, for all his poſterity, that ſeed and generation that ſhould be born of him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he might thereby advance the free grace of the Father and of the Son. (1.) The free grace of the Father is much exalted by it in two things. [1] In the motion of it; it came firſt from him, his taking of us actually into Covenant, is a part of the purchaſe of Chriſt, and he hath bought the Souls of the Elect, it is the price of his blood, and it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he dyed that he doth not abide alone: but the taking of Chriſt into Covenant, it did not come firſt from Chriſt, but the motion was the Fathers; the Son can do nothing of himſelf: <hi>I came not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me.</hi> [2.<note place="margin">Joh 5.19.</note>] In his accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Covenant, it was free with him to make it, and therefore the obedience of Chriſt was free with him to accept; if Chriſt had offered himſelf, and had laid down his life, it is true, it was, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, all that God in Juſtice could expect, and it was a price ſufficient, for all that ever Chriſt did purchaſe; yet there is grace in the bowels of all this, becauſe it was free with the Lord to accept of the righteouſneſs of another to become ours: This gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious acceptation and imputation, the Lord doth ſhew forth abundantly, in the Covenant made with Chriſt himſelf; for being a Covenant, it muſt be free. (2.) It doth alſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly advance the Grace of the Son in this, That Chriſt being God equal with the Father, having a perfect dominion over his own actions, and being Lord of his own life, having a power to lay down his life, as he ſaith, <hi>No man takes it from me, but I lay it down;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 10.18.</note> That he ſhould freely and voluntarily bind himſelf in a Covenant in this manner, to abaſe himſelf, to ſtand in our ſtead, to bear our ſins, and to be under a Curſe for us, and to conſent unto this cheerfully and willingly, as a thing in which he is pleaſed and delighted, to ſhew forth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the love of his Father, and to his people, and to undertake all of it,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.10.</note> and to bind himſelf thereunto by his own voluntary conſent, who otherwiſe was not, could not be bound: For there is this difference between the Covenant of the firſt and the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was bound to obey by a bond of creation, and he was bound to be ſubject; but the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> was not ſo, he was perfectly free, and yet he is willing by Covenant to be bound: And the Lord herein dealt, as <hi>Aelian</hi> hath a Story of <hi>Zaleucus,</hi> a Ruler in the City <hi>Locris,</hi> who had made a Law againſt Adultery, that it ſhould be puniſhed with the loſs of both eyes, and his ſon was afterwards accuſed and condemned of the ſame offence, and the whole City in honour to his Father became Suitors unto him to ſpare his Son; but the ſtory ſays, he did firſt put out one of his own eyes, and afterwards one of his Sons, and thereby ſatisfied the Law: And ſo between a juſt legiſlator and a merciful father he divided himſelf. Had the Lord ſo dealt with us, and laid part of the puniſhment upon us, and part upon Chriſt, we had been undone; but Chriſt undertook all for us, <hi>to pour out his ſoul to death,</hi>

                     </note> and bear the ſins of many, being that to which he was not bound, and that which he could not have been forced to; and yet to make himſelf by Covenant a debter, it exalts free Grace, nothing more.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Lords intention was in the whole work of Redemption, to deal with Chriſt in a judicial way, as he is the judge of all the World, that he may have his juſtice ſatisfied, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. He doth all to declare his righteouſneſs. Now in a way of juſtice, there are but two ways to make a man guilty of ſin, and obnoxious to puniſhment, either from ſin <hi>inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> or <hi>imputed;</hi> and this of imputation, is either from a <hi>natural</hi> Union as it is in us, and therefore we are guilty of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin; or by <hi>voluntary</hi> Union, and by way of ſuretiſhip, when one perſon free in himſelf, doth willingly take upon him the guilt of another mans of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and ſubject himſelf unto the puniſhment for it: And either of theſe may be a ground of proceeding againſt ſuch a perſon in juſtice. Now Chriſt hath in him no ſin by nature, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inherent or imputed, he knew no ſin, neither was there guile found in his mouth;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52030:81" rendition="simple:additions"/> though he were a Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> yet being begotten by the Holy Ghoſt, and not coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, and deſcending from <hi>Adam</hi> in a natural way, and being God and man in one perſon, he could not naturally and neceſſarily come under <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant, but was in this reſpect ſeparate from ſinners; but by way of Covenant, and voluntary undertaking, ſo he was made ſin for us, and ſo he was made a Curſe, and ſo he doth confeſs our ſins as his own, and ſo bears them, it being the guilt that he had taken upon him, and thereupon God dealt with him as an enemy, and laid upon him all the wrath that was due to Sin: Now the ground of all this dealing of God, was only the Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is the Apoſtles reaſon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. for the juſtifying of a ſinner by Faith, that the promiſe may be ſure to all the Seed, becauſe it puts the whole power and the righteouſneſs by which we are juſtified out of our ſelves in another; ſo it is here, the Lord will have the Covenant made with Chriſt, and ingage him therein, that the promiſe may be ſure to all the Seed; the Lord knew that we would fail him, and there was nothing to be expected from us;<note place="margin">Pſal. 89.19.</note> and therefore ſays, <hi>I have laid help upon one that is mighty,</hi> and one that is every way able to ſatisfie; and I have put it upon him, and from him I will expect it, he hath undertaken it: and therefore God doth take all our ſins from us, and put them upon him; as it is ſaid, <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.19.</note> putting their treſpaſſes upon him, but not upon them; and it is obſervable, though we come into the ſame Covenant with Chriſt in point of obedience, yet in point of ſatisfaction he takes only Chriſts ſingle Bond, and he will never ask any thing of us till Chriſt fail him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3<hi>dly. When did the Lord make this Covenant with Chriſt, and when was it to take place?</hi> 1. This Covenant paſſed between God and Chriſt, the Father and the Son, before the World began. <hi>How many are thy thoughts to usward? Dan.</hi> 8.13. It is Chriſt that knew the thoughts of God whoſe name is <hi>Palmoni, qui ſecreta numerata habet peccata, who hath all our ſecret ſins numbered.</hi> And what be thoſe <hi>thoughts?</hi> It is <hi>ſacrifice and burnt offerings thou wouldeſt not, &amp;c.</hi> thoughts of ſatisfaction to the juſtice of God, and the redemption of the elect by a ſacrifice; and they are no new thoughts, but ſuch as God took up from eternity, and ſuch tranſactions as paſt between God and Chriſt before his coming into the World; <hi>And then ſaid I, Lo I come to do thy will, O God: In the beginning of his way I was ſet up,</hi> as a King, and Prieſt, and Prophet from eternity; and this not only in decree and appointment, but alſo by covenant and compact, and by mutual agreement between them: For all that vaſt eternity that they ſpent by themſelves, was ſpent wholly in matter of delight, and that was double, (1) The Father and the Son delighted one in another: <hi>I was his delight daily.</hi> (2) The Son delighted in the ſalvation of man, and the ſame word is uſed in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. And it is ſpoken of man fallen; for it is <hi>in the habitable parts of the earth,</hi> that is, of all mankind ſcattered throughout the whole face of the earth, whereſoever men dwell: And there was neither Angels, nor any part of the works of God mentioned, but this only; and this delight was while it was only in the expectation of it, in beholding the purpoſe of God and thoſe vaſt thoughts of Glory that the Lord had laid up there. <hi>Titus</hi> 1.2. there is a promiſe of <hi>eternal life,</hi> which could not be but unto our repreſentative, one that did enter into Covenant. And 'tis ſaid, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>There is grace given us in Chriſt before the world began.</hi> 2. But yet this Covenant was not actually to take place till man was fallen. (1) It is a Covenant of reconciliation, and it doth ſuppoſe God and man at variance; and it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Children were partakers of fleſh and blood, therefore he himſelf took part of the ſame, <hi>He was made under the Law, to redeem us that were under the Law:</hi> Our deliverance muſt be by Redemption, and the Covenant of Reconciliation. (2.) It muſt be by a Prieſt, one to offer a ſacrifice, and it muſt be after man had loſt all other ſacrifices, that he muſt come. <hi>The blood of Bulls could not take away ſin, Heb.</hi> 10. and yet it did take place immediately after the fall, Chriſt <hi>was a Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the world;</hi> not only as to the decree, but as to the efficacy; and it is by vertue of that agreement between God and Chriſt, that the Lord under the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> pardoned all the Saints barely upon the word of Chriſt, before he had paid any part of the debt; and therefore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. Chriſt did not only dye with reference unto the ſins of the World, that were to come, but thoſe that were paſt, and the men were in poſſeſſion of all, becauſe the juſtice of God was ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, though only in the covenant and promiſe between them; God looking upon Chriſt to come, and they exerciſing their faith upon Chriſt that was to come. And now ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is given, Chriſt relies upon the Covenant between him and his Father for the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; as the Father took Chriſts word for ſatisfaction and oblation before his coming. It is one of the greateſt grounds of faith that is in the Word of God, that Chriſt is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by Covenant, as well as unto us; and therefore he being the Son, will be faithful to his Father: And alſo that God is ingaged unto Chriſt as well as unto us, and therefore will be faithful to him alſo, and will not break with the Son; therefore ſurely his enemies ſhall be
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52030:81"/> deſtroyed that riſe up againſt the Kingdom of Chriſt; for he is ingaged to <hi>make his foes his footſtool:</hi> There are three things that are crying amongſt men, (1) The cry of Blood. (2) The wages of a Hireling. (3) The will of the dead unperformed. Now here is all the Blood of Chriſt ſhed, and he as a Servant did all by Covenant, and Chriſt dying did give Legacies, that by the means of death, they that are called may receive the promiſe of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life; it is a Teſtament confirmed by the death of the Teſtator: Surely it ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, for it is a Covenant made unto Chriſt; and if you did love him, your hearts would rejoyce more in the performance of it as to Chriſt, than unto your ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="3">§. 3. I come now unto the fourth particular in the opening of the point; That is, the <hi>Terms</hi> of the Covenant, as they did paſs between the Father and the Son, and are ſet forth in the Scripture. A Covenant is an agreement upon certain Conditions unto which two perſons, or parties, by mutual conſent do freely bind themſelves: So that in a Covenant properly, and ſo in this, there are four things. (1) The parties that make the Covenant muſt be free. (2) The Articles or Terms muſt be propounded. (3) There muſt be a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, free and full conſent. (4) By this conſent they are bound each to other.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In a Covenant the parties muſt be free, and in their own power; and therefore in Vows to God, or Covenants with men, if one under the power of another do Vow or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, it is in his power under whom he is, to diſannul and make it void.<note place="margin">Numb. 30. 4.8.</note> And therefore Divines do here commonly obſerve two things, (1) The difference between a Law and a Covenant; a Law being the act of a Superior that hath power over another, doth bind, whether the party bound thereby doth conſent or no; for it is an act of the Will of a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior upon one that is ſubject to his will: but it is not ſo in a Covenant, it doth require con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in both parties. (2) They diſtinguiſh between the Covenant that paſſed between the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and that which God made with the ſecond <hi>Adam:</hi> The Covenant made with the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was ſuch, that though his conſent was neceſſary to make it a Covenant, elſe it had been only a command, yet unto this Covenant by the right of creation he was bound to conſent, and conſenting it was but his duty; and there was a duty which lay upon him <hi>antecedente<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> to conſent unto that Covenant, and the terms that God ſhould propound: But it was not ſo in the Covenant that God made with the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> he was free to accept of the terms of the Covenant or no, when God had propounded them, ſo that there was no duty that lay upon him anteceeding his conſent. So that the Covenant between God and man is not properly ſuch a Covenant as is between God and Chriſt, and between man and man, in which each party is free, and not bound to any thing but by his own conſent. Now (1) conſider God is free, and a debtor unto none; God the Father who hath the firſt and the great hand in the Covenant, and in propounding the terms thereof, is debtor to none: For he that is the firſt cauſe and the laſt end, of whom all things are, and to whom they are, he can be debtor unto none; but ſo God the Father is, of whom are all things: And that is <hi>Aquinas</hi>'s rule<note n="*" place="margin">Deus non eſt debitor, quia ad alia non ordinatur, ſed omnia adſeip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum. Pſal. 40.7. Heb. 10.7.</note>.<note place="margin">Rom. 11.36.</note> (2) Chriſt is free and in his own power. [1] If we conſider him as the Son, the ſecond perſon, with whom properly the Covenant was made; for God did agree with the Son that he ſhould take the nature of man upon him, and in that nature ſuffer and ſatisfie; and his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry taking of mans nature was an act of obedience and duty that was due from the Son by Covenant, and he did it in reference to the will and command of the Father, as he did all other things, either doing, or ſuffering in that nature. John 1.2. <hi>The word is God,</hi> and <hi>thought it no robbery to be equal with God, Phil.</hi> 2.7. and therefore is free even as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and is not bound unto any duty but by his own conſent. [2.] If we conſider Chriſt as man, in that he was not free; for he was bound unto the Law and to all the duties of it as he was a creature: It's true he having taken the nature of man, was by his Covenant bound to offer that nature as a ſacrifice for Gods ſatisfaction, and for mans ſanctification, in that nature he was to be made ſin, and to bear our Curſe. If we do conſider Chriſt as meer man, then he was bound indeed unto the Law by right of creation as well as we, but if we conſider him as God and Man, ſo we cannot ſay that he is bound; for <hi>actiones ſunt ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum:</hi> And our Divines generally ſay, that there is a communication of properties between the two natures; ſo that he does offer himſelf by the <hi>eternal Spirit, Heb.</hi> 4.14. All his actions and paſſions in our nature, are not only humane but Divine, being from him who was both God and Man, and that he was no otherways bound to obey God in that nature, than he was to aſſume the nature; no Law did require that his obedience ſhould be the obedience of God, and that God ſhould be ſatisfied by the blood of God, and that he ſhould ſuffer that did never ſin; this was from the Covenant of God the Father, and the ſuperabundan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> grace of God the Son: And therefore when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>that he received a commandment to obey,</hi> it refers only to his obligation by covenant, and not by any antecedent duty that he did owe his Father.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The terms of the Covenant or Articles of agreement that did paſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and the Son, are contained in two things: (1) Something that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:52030:82"/> the Father did require of the Son. (2) Something that the Father did promiſe the Son. 1. There is a ſervice that the Father doth propound unto the Son, and that is double, (1) That he ſhould take upon him the form of a Servant, <hi>The children being partakers of fleſh and blood that he ſhould take part of the ſame:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 2.14. <hi>Bernard.</hi> Rom 3.26.</note> He took not only the form of a Servant that he might be ſubject, but alſo of an evil Servant that he might be beaten; he was willing to take the body that the Father had prepared for him, that he might be bruiſed by him. (2) That in that nature he ſhould perform whatever was neceſſary for the ſatisfaction of God, or the ſanctification of man; and in all things he muſt be Gods ſervant, do his will, and ſerve his ends, deny himſelf, humble and abaſe himſelf, that his Father may be exalted. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. 1. He did whatever is required unto the perfect <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of God. The Juſtice of God is twofold, (1) <hi>Remunerative juſtice,</hi> in reference unto the precept of the Law, as man was a creature. (2) <hi>Vindicative juſtice,</hi> in reference to the curſe of the Law, as man was a ſinner; and he that ſhall give a perfect <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> to Juſtice muſt perform both theſe. (1) In reference to the precept of the Law, and the Remunerative juſtice of God, ſo God did require of his Son that he ſhould perfectly obey that Law that man had broken; and this obedience of Chriſt conſiſts [1] In this, That it muſt proceed from a nature perfectly anſwering the Law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. he was holy and harmleſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> [2] Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly actions;<note place="margin">Matt. 7.3. Joh. 8.29. Rom. 8.2, 5, 19,</note> he did fulfill all righteouſneſs, and it is becoming him ſo to do, <hi>He knew no ſin, neither was there guile found in his mouth.</hi> [3] Herein he did continue, and perſevere unto the end. He doth always the things that do pleaſe him, and theſe go unto Gods ſatisfaction and to our juſtification; as by <hi>Adams</hi> actual diſobedience many are made ſinners, ſo by Chriſts active obedience many are made righteous:<note place="margin">Rom. 3. <hi>laſt.</hi> Dan. 9.23. Rom. 8.3.</note> And he ſaith, <hi>he came not to deſtroy the law, but to fulfill it.</hi> And the way of the Goſpel doth not make void the Law but eſtabliſh it, and there are two parts that Chriſt muſt act, to finiſh tranſgreſſion, and make an end of ſin, and to bring in an everlaſting righteouſneſs; and therefore the righteouſneſs of the Law is ſaid to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in us, and it is the righteouſneſs of the Law, and that which doth exactly anſwer the Law in all things:<note place="margin">Ambroſ.</note> It is fulfilled in us, while it is imputed to us. (2) In reference to the curſe of the Law and the vindicative juſtice of God, and herein are four things. [1] He muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent our perſons, and therefore he is called <hi>a ſurety,</hi> that muſt ſtand inſtead of the debtor, as the ſacrifice did dye inſtead of the man: And he is ſaid to bear our names in his heart, as the High Prieſt did upon his breaſt-plate, as one that repreſented all theſe before God; and therefore he is ſaid to be made <hi>ſin for us,</hi> and a <hi>curſe for us,</hi> and to ſuffer <hi>the juſt for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt: for us,</hi> that is, in our ſtead: Therefore we need not ſay, how can one perſon make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for ſo many thouſands? Truly there is a worth and an excellency in the perſon of Chriſt, equivalent to the perſons of all the elect, and he did as their ſurety, repreſent them all before the Lord.

                     </gap>, ſome do underſtand it of the <hi>Book of Gods Decrees,</hi> and ſo this of Chriſt was firſt, the Lord priviledging him to be the Churches head; in the firſt page of this Book it was written of him that he ſhould do his will: others underſtand it of the <hi>Book of the Scriptures,</hi> the Prophecies and Predictions of Chriſt in them; and the Lord, in them, did foretell what paſt between the Father and the Son at the Council Table of Heaven, before ever Chriſt came into the World; the Lord Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Sacrifice and burnt-offering thou wouldeſt not,</hi> it would not ſatisfie him; but thou haſt told the World of me, that it was thy will that I ſhould do it, and I am ready to obey,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note>

Satan ſtands at his right hand, as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of accuſing was in antient times (as we ſee in <hi>Jobs</hi> inſtance) but Chriſt makes anſwer for them; there is a difference between Chriſt as a ſurety, and as a publick perſon, who in the Law is to preſent another, and act for him as in his ſtead, as an Attourney or an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. (5) Chriſt is their Interceſſor, he offers their ſacrifices, and attains all mercies for them: He offers them ſacrifices mixed with his own odours;<note place="margin">Iſa. 53. <hi>laſt verſ.</hi> Rev. 8.3, 5.</note> for his blood is a ſpeaking blood, and it is always ſprinkled before the mercy ſeat.

Now follows the promiſe, if Chriſt doth perform this in obedience to his Father, not ſeeking his own glory, but the glory of him that ſent him, God doth aſſure him (1) of aſſiſtance in his work, he ſhall have all the power of God ingaged to carry him through it, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.4, 6. <hi>I will hold thy hand, and thou ſhalt not be diſcouraged, Iſa.</hi> 45.1.

                  <p n="3">3. Unto theſe Articles both parties agree, and 4. they are bound by their own conſent. (1) Chriſt doth accept of this office upon the Fathers terms, and doth freely ſubmit unto the Fathers will; he takes the nature of man, and in that nature ſubjects himſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.5. <hi>He gave his face to the ſmiters,</hi> and he did the work that the Father ſent him to do, and he failed not in a tittle thereof; and he doth it freely and cheerfully, 'tis as his meat and drink, <hi>Lo, I come to do thy will, O God.</hi> And he is now in Heaven by vertue of office,<note place="margin">Pſal. 40.8.</note> as he is God the Fathers ſervant, as our <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, &amp;c. (2) Upon theſe promiſes he doth exerciſe faith, and his ſoul reſts upon them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.7, 9. <hi>The Lord will help me, my God ſhall be my ſtrength,</hi>

It is his God by Covenant; Chriſt is the higheſt pattern of believing, and as a publick perſon truſts God for all the benefits of the Covenant for himſelf and us. (3) The promiſes of this Covenant he doth follow by a continued Prayer; for he doth obtain it by Prayer, as we do, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Ask of me, and I will give thee, &amp;c.</hi> John 17.4. <hi>Now glorifie me,</hi> now let the glory of the Godhead ſhine forth in the humane nature, the time of my ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering being ended. (4) All the glory that Chriſt has now in Heaven and Earth, is nothing
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52030:83"/> elſe but in performance of this Covenant, that the Father made with him, God hath exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and he hath received the promiſe of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.33. Chriſt muſt firſt ſuffer, and afterwards enter into his glory, and he hath fulfilled it, and the <hi>Lord hath given him as a light to the Gentiles,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 49.8.</note> 
                     <hi>and for ſalvation to the ends of the earth.</hi> (5) He is in conſtant expectation of the full accompliſhment hereof, when the glory of Chriſt in his myſtical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhall be full, and his joy full, and his ſufferings full, and his enemies perfectly ſubdued, and his people perfectly glorified,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.13.</note> and all this by vertue of the Covenant that paſt between God and him, grounded upon the love and faithfulneſs of God in Covenant, being a God that keeps covenant for ever.</p>
                  <p n="4">§. 4. Now the Uſes and Corollaries that follows from this part of the Covenant, which was made with Chriſt in reference unto the truſt that he hath undertaken, are many, and of very great uſe both for matter of inſtruction, and of practice.</p>
                  <p>Uſe 1. This gives us a great light into the election of Chriſt. The Scripture doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly aſſert, <hi>that he is the elect of God,</hi> choſen both to duty and glory, a work that he was to do,<note place="margin">Iſa. 42.1.</note> and a reward that he was to receive, and we are ſaid to be choſen in him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. which notes properly the order in which God elects his Saints. Firſt Chriſt God and Man, as the head, as <hi>primus foederatus,</hi> the prime ſederate, after whom, and in whom, in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature all the body are elected, ſo that the grace of election begins firſt in Chriſt our head, and deſcends unto us in him, it notes the order in which we are elected, and not the cauſe of our election; not that we were firſt elected, and then Chriſt choſen by occaſion of our fall; but he is the firſt born in the womb of Gods election, <hi>The firſt born amongſt many brethren.</hi> Now the election of man is an act of ſovereignty, and meerly comes under the will of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>He has mercy on whom he will have mercy:</hi> And as the Potter has power over the clay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But Chriſt as God could not come under an act of his will, as election is, but by his own conſent, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.5. It is <hi>according to the good pleaſure of his will,</hi> he is appointed Heir of all things, as he was the Son, he was <hi>haeres natus,</hi> a born heir, that being an act of his nature; but as the head of the Church, ſo he was, <hi>hares conſtitutus,</hi> a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted heir, and comes under an act of Gods will. Chriſt was elected to be Gods great ſervant in reference unto man, and that under a double conſideration, (1) as a <hi>ſurety,</hi> (2) as an <hi>Advocate,</hi> or a <hi>common perſon:</hi> And in theſe two I conceive Chriſt as our repreſentative is ſet forth, (1) as a <hi>ſurety,</hi> that did undertake to do a thing for another, and doth by his own conſent bind himſelf thereunto, and when he hath done it for the party, then he is diſcharged of his bond, and the party alſo for whom he was bound unto the performance: And in this ſence Chriſt was made ſin for us, and laid down an anſwerable price for us; (2) as a common perſon, as one who perſonates another, and acts his part by the allowance and authority of Law; ſo that what he doth, is by the Law reckoned to be done by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom he repreſents, and a poſſeſſion taken by him, ſtands good in Law, as if it had been taken by the other: And this the Lord hath made Chriſt unto us, that according unto all ſorts of Laws among men, our redemption and ſalvation by him might be to declare his righteouſneſs;<note place="margin">Rom. 3.25.</note> that by all ſorts of legal conſiderations amongſt men it might hold good in a way of Juſtice: And unto theſe two great ends, as a double repreſentative of all men as the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> Chriſt was elected, and we in him, as in a common head. Now, though man as a creature ſubjected unto the ſovereignty of God, comes under an act of his will, yet the Lord Chriſt being the Son, and thought it no robbery to be equal with God, did not; and therefore as he did not ſuffer without his own conſent, (for a ſacrifice it could not be unleſs voluntary, the perſon having a power over himſelf and his own actions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord did not by his authority impoſe it upon him whether he would or no) ſo his being choſen to it was by his conſent, that as he did chuſe you together with the Father, and had an equal hand in your election, <hi>I know whom I have choſen,</hi> and as you were from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity given unto Chriſt by his Father in your election,<note place="margin">Rev. 13.8.</note> 
                     <hi>thine they were, and thou gaveſt them to me;</hi> ſo did Chriſt alſo conſent unto his own election, and it was not meerly by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the Father as an act of his will and ſovereignty, as the election of man was; but the Father did appoint him, and Chriſt did conſent unto that appointment and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Father before the World began; and therefore as he became a ſurety by his own will, ſo he was by his own will appointed a ſurety and a common perſon for all the elect of God. And herein we ſee the great ground of the Covenant between God and Chriſt, before the World was: God did not chuſe Chriſt as a perſon that was to be choſen, as he did chuſe you, but <hi>The word was with God, God was the word, John</hi> 1.2. and there were tranſactions and conſultations between God and Chriſt before the world was, and upon the Fathers motion, and the Sons conſent, he was choſen unto this great ſervice, and you in him; ſo that the Covenant between the Father and the Son, doth reach as high as to be the great ground of the election of Chriſt unto this great ſervice and office that he hath undertaken:
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52030:83" rendition="simple:additions"/> For God did not impoſe it upon him as an act of his dominion, but barely by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and as he did not call him unto the execution without his own conſent, ſo his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent did concur unto his election, for election is an act of the will of God, and of his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty; and as he was the Son, he could not come under an act of his will but by his own conſent.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> 2. We may hence ſee how deep the plot of our Redemption and Salvation by Chriſt was laid; it was not a thing occaſionally taken up, and barely to ſerve a turne, but it was a plotted thing. I confeſs the Scriptures do hold forth the Incarnation of Chriſt to be the ground of his redeeming men that were ſinners; <hi>He came to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt; and when we were weak, God commended his love to us in this, that he dyed for the ungodly, &amp;c.</hi> But the foundation of this was laid in a deep counſel between the Father and his Son, at the Council-Table in Heaven before the World was; and the Covenant of mans Redemption was made with our ſurety before the Covenant of your Creation was made with you: And ſo much thoſe two words, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22, 23. <hi>the Lord poſſeſſed me,</hi> and <hi>the Lord anointed me,</hi> do neceſſarily import; and that word alſo, <hi>Mic.</hi> 5.2. <hi>His goings forth as from the days of eternity:</hi> Which, as <hi>Calvin</hi> expounds it, refer unto the Mediator as being head of the Church, and not unto his eternal generation, as is commonly expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and this is the ground of Chriſts <hi>delight with the ſons of men</hi> before the World was,<note place="margin">Prov. 8.31.</note> as thoſe whoſe names he had covenanted to bear, and whoſe perſons he had ingaged himſelf to repreſent before the Father: And this ſhews how the deſign of God from everlaſting hath been to ſave ſinners, and to glorifie himſelf in a way of mercy, and grace, through a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator: And it is the conſideration hereof, that is the greateſt ingagement in the World to ſinners to come in and return to him, becauſe <hi>God is in Chriſt reconciling the world, &amp;c.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.19.</note> For he did undertake to repreſent your perſons as your ſurety and repreſentative, before the world was. (1) This Covenant made with Chriſt could not indeed actually take place as unto us till man was fallen, becauſe it was in the hand of a Mediator, and required ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by way of a ſacrifice; but yet though it be laſt in execution, it was firſt in intention; and the Covenant of Works made in your creation, is only called the firſt Covenant in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference unto the relation and diſcovery of it unto us; but it was the Covenant of Grace in Chriſt that was the firſt Covenant in it ſelf, and firſt paſt between the Father and the Son from everlaſting; and this ſhews how exceedingly the heart of God was ingaged in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you were, before you had need of a Surety, for the Lord to appoint one, and enter into a Covenant with him to perform this work, for God to create the World firſt, and bring men into it, and for the Lord to take notice of mans neceſſity, of a help meet for him, before man did obſerve any ſuch want of himſelf, this was an argument of great love and care of God towards man; but to provide not only a meet help, but a meet Mediator, and to take care to provide for your ſalvation and his own glory therein, before he did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to your creation, this ſhews how ſtrangely his heart was ſet upon this great deſign of glorifying himſelf in the World in a way of Grace in your Salvation. (2) If he had only taken up this purpoſe in himſelf, it had ſet forth much love and good will; (for his Purpoſes and Decrees are immutable as himſelf is, and there can nothing ariſe, <hi>de novo,</hi> that ſhould cauſe him to change his purpoſe;) but more, that he proceeded herein to a treaty with his Son about it to be his Servant in this great work, to bring <hi>Jacob</hi> again unto him;<note place="margin">Iſa. 49.</note> and made a ſolemn Covenant paſs between theſe glorious perſons about it, and that thoſe thoughts ſhould delight them before the World began, and that the Lord ſhould beſpeak his Son with all the terms of dearneſs that can be to undertake this ſervice; <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee;</hi> and therefore being his Son, it was only an office fit for him; and as being his Son, there was all fitneſs in him, ſo there was all dearneſs to him; and by this Chriſt did, upon this motion of the Fathers, undertake this ſervice, and there was a ſolemn Covenant paſſed between them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.21. And thus the Lord did as it were bind him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Son unto this great work of your Salvation before the World was, not only laying his love, but alſo his faithfulneſs to pawn, though not in a Covenant to you before you were, yet in a Covenant to his Son; and therefore there was a promiſe of eternal life given us in him before the World began. (3) When he doth Covenant with Chriſt to be a Prieſt,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.2.</note> it is a Covenant that he confirms by an Oath, to ſhew that he doth never intend to alter and change his reſolution, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.4. <hi>The Lord has ſworn and will not repent, &amp;c.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 110.4. Heb. 7.21.</note> This Prieſt was made by an Oath by him that ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou art my Son;</hi> the Lord ſwore and will not repent, and this was from everlaſting; for then it was that Chriſt was firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed or ſet apart to become a Prieſt. Now all this ſhews, how much the heart of God was in it: For the Word of God is as true as his Oath, and as infallible, and therefore if he had but ſaid it, it had been enough, for there is a greater ſtability in his Word than there is in Heaven and Earth; but yet it is obſerved by Divines, that between the Word of God
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52030:84"/> and his Oath there is this difference, though the Lord ſpeaks the word, yet there may be ſome ſecret and tacite condition, or ſome ſubſequent declaration of the mind of God. As for <hi>Nineveh</hi> God ſaid, <hi>Within fourty days Nineveh ſhould be deſtroyed;</hi> yet there was an imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed condition of repentance, which being performed, the Judgement was not executed. And ſo to <hi>Ely, I ſaid that thy fathers houſe ſhould walk before me for ever, but now I ſay Be it far from me;</hi> and ſo the promiſe is reverſed; and it may be that is the meaning of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in <hi>Numbers, You ſhall know my breach of Covenant:</hi> But if God ſwears, it ſhews the unchangeableneſs of his counſel, an abſolute act that nothing can ariſe <hi>de novo,</hi> and nothing can be ſuppoſed that can cauſe God to change it; he will never have a relenting thought for the pardon of ſins, and ſaving of ſinners for ever; and therefore he ſwore, and made him a Prieſt by an Oath; and this Oath ſome conceive to be <hi>the ſeal of God,</hi> by which he did in a ſolemn manner ſet apart his Son for this great office, and deſigned him to it from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:<note place="margin">Joh. 6.27.</note> 
                     <hi>John</hi> 6.27. <hi>Him hath God the father ſealed:</hi> So that as he has ſealed up his decrees concerning you, that they can never receive an alteration or change more, how changeable ſoever you be;<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.19.</note> as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>The foundation of God remains ſure, having this ſeal, the Lord knows who are his;</hi> ſo he hath ſealed up alſo his Covenant with Chriſt, and that by an Oath: Now if it were but a Kings Seal, who could reverſe it? But this is <hi>the King of Kings.</hi> (4) We ſee that their hearts were much in it; for neither of theſe perſons ever repented of it to this day. [1] If God the Father would have repented, a man would have expected that it ſhould have been when he came to make his Son an offering for ſin: Oh! what relenting thoughts, and rolling of bowels had <hi>Abraham</hi> when his Son muſt dye, and he himſelf muſt have a hand therein, and become the executioner? So it pleaſed the Father to bruiſe him,<note place="margin">Matt. 26.29.</note> and <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.29. there is a <hi>neceſſity</hi> or an <hi>impoſſibility</hi> ſpoken of, and it lay wholly in the will of God; for ſo he adds, <hi>not my will, but thy will be done:</hi> If God could have changed his Will, Chriſt might have lived, and the Cup paſſed away; but God had covenanted to make him a <hi>ſurety,</hi> he had made him a Prieſt by an Oath, and his will could not change, he could not repent of it; therefore this Cup he muſt drink. Thus <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5. the ſame word is uſed, and it ſignifies, <hi>to beat a thing to pieces as in a Mortar;</hi> and God was pleaſed with it. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.2. The offering of Chriſt was to God a <hi>Sacrifice of a ſweet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;</hi> What made it ſo? Only the end; <hi>Finis dat mediis amabilitatem,</hi> the end gives ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the means: Had it not been for that, the Lord muſt needs have abhorred it. [2] And Chriſt accepts of the Covenant and never repented; he did never call back his word, or change his ingagement; he had the law of dying written in the middle of his bowels; as it was the pleaſure of the Lord, ſo it was his; <hi>with deſire have I deſired it; and I have a baptiſm, and I am ſtraitned till it be fulfilled.</hi>

Thence we ſee the ground of the pardoning of all the ſins of the ancient Saints under the firſt Teſtament, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. The debt was not paid, and the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was not offered, and yet their ſins were pardoned, and their ſouls ſaved; it was by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Covenant and ingagement of Chriſt unto God the Father; there was blood of Bulls and Goats, and that could only ſignifie Chriſt, but could not ſatisfie God; but when Chriſt came and performed the Covenant, now he ſatisfied for the tranſgreſſions under the firſt Teſtament, and in this reſpect he was a Lamb ſlain from the beginning, (though offered in the latter days of the World) becauſe the Covenant immediately from the fall of man took place, and God looked upon him by virtue of this Covenant as our ſurety, and required all of him.</p>

And <hi>Zach.</hi> 6.8. There is a ſpirit that in a way of providence will never leave ſtirring up the ſpirits of men, till this great work be effected: For the Lord hath ſaid, <hi>Sit thou at my right hand, till I have made thy enemies thy footſtool:</hi> And he ſhall have a name written upon his right hand and forehead, King of Kings and Lord of Lords. (2) On Chriſts part, if he might diſregard us now he is in Heaven, yet his Covenant and ingagement is unto the Father of Heaven, he hath promiſed and vowed obedience; and therefore, as he hath as our ſurety performed all that which he was bound to in his ſtate of humiliation, ſo he will alſo do in his ſtate of exaltation and glory, apply all the benefits of his death, and attain all for you that he hath purchaſed for you, and will come again to fetch you; for he aroſe as your ſurety, and he is exalted as your repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, and is gone to Heaven as your <hi>forerunner;</hi> and therefore he vvill ſurely gather in his
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52030:84"/> Saints, compleat their number, and perfect their Graces, and their light; <hi>The light of the moon ſhall be as that of the ſun, and the weak ſhall be as David,</hi> for courage and boldneſs in the cauſe of God; and the ſtronger Chriſtian that was before as <hi>David,</hi>

When you ſee God making good his Covenant unto Chriſt in any of the parts of it, rejoyce in it: <hi>If you loved me you would rejoyce, becauſe I go to the father; Love does di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide griefs, and multiply joys:</hi> He is your Husband, your Head, your Friend, and Surety; in the good that is beſtowed upon him you may have a ſhare. Now when the Lord plucks down Enemies, defeats Counſels, ſhakes Mountains out of their places, works great changes in the earth, the foundations are caſt down, all this is but to make a place for the throne of Chriſt, that he may be exalted in the earth, and that this Stone may fill the earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.16, 17.

THat the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the perſon with whom primarily and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally the ſecond Covenant is made, muſt be conſidered two ways, (1) In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Office that he hath undertaken. (2) As he is the head of the Church, and makes up one body with them. And theſe two are to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> diſtinguiſhed, and have in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant diſtinct conſiderations; for there are ſome promiſes that belong unto Chriſt alone, as made unto his office, the promiſe of <hi>bringing Jacob to him,</hi> of aſſiſtance and acceptance in the work of juſtification by his righteouſneſs, and the honour of having a name above every name, and the Angels of God to worſhip him, of a reſurrection from the dead, without ſeeing corruption; which though promiſed unto <hi>David,</hi> yet never was fulfilled unto any of the Types, but in his own perſon, as the Apoſtle ſets it forth, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.36, 37. <hi>For Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid ſaw corruption:</hi> And there are other promiſes that are made unto him as he is our Head, and to us in him, in which together with him, we have a ſhare, and are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers. And there are ſome acts of office which belong unto him alone, which though we have benefit by, yet we have no ſhare in; for redemption belongs unto him alone, and there is no other name given under Heaven, but one Mediator between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus: and as there is but one Mediator for ſatisfaction, ſo but one for interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion alſo; for none hath to do with the Cenſer to offer Incenſe upon the Golden Altar, that hath not alſo to do at the Brazen Altar to offer ſacrifice; and though in our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Juſtitia Mediatoris,</hi> the righteouſneſs of the Mediator is imputed unto us, yet not <hi>Juſtitia Mediatoria,</hi> not the mediatory righteouſneſs: The righteouſneſs of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip belongs to him alone, who is <hi>Jehovah</hi> our righteouſneſs.<note place="margin">Jer. 23.6.</note> Therefore this firſt branch of the Covenant, though it were made with Chriſt for us; (for whatever he was, and whatever he did was for us, for us he deſcended into the lower parts of the earth, and for us he aſcended far above all Heavens) yet it was not a Covenant made with us formally; for the acts were to be performed by him without us, and the promiſes made unto him,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52030:85"/> though for our good, yet were not made unto us: But the Covenant that now we are to ſpeak of, is the Covenant of Grace made with us, but with Chriſt primarily and principally and with us in him, as he is the head and we his members.</p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>The Covenant of grace made with the Saints, is primarily and principally made with Chriſt, as he is the Churches head, and the ſecond Adam.</hi> In the opening of this Doctrine, I will (1) give you ſome Demonſtration for the proof of it. (2) Give you the Reaſons or Grounds of it. (3) Anſwer ſome Objections that may ariſe againſt it. (4) Make Application of the point. 1. <hi>The arguments</hi> and demonſtrations for the proof of it are many.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.47. Rom. 5.14.</note> 1. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the ſecond <hi>Adam; Adam</hi> is ſaid to be the type of him that was to come: Now wherein did this type lye? The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was a publick perſon, a repreſentative head; and there were two things that made him ſo. (1) He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Covenant for his poſterity; the Covenant was made with them, but with them in him; therefore in him all ſinned. (2) There was an Image laid up in him, not only for himſelf, but for all his poſterity; and they did all bear the Image of the earthy: ſo is Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> being a publick and common perſon in both reſpects, as he had a Covenant made with him; and therefore as we are ſaid to bear the Image of the heavenly,<note place="margin">Iſa. 49.8.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.49. ſo he is ſaid alſo to be given as a Covenant to the people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6. Therefore as the firſt Covenant was made primarily and immediately with the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo was the ſecond Covenant made primarily and immediately with the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> alſo.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How do all the Saints come into the ſecond Covenant? How does a man become a Covenanter here? How does a man become a Covenanter in the firſt Covenant? It is by Union with the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> we muſt be one with him, before we can ſin in him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Angels are not guilty of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, nor men of the Angels ſin; becauſe they were not one with them, they came not under their Covenant. So all men do come under the Covenant of Grace, as they are one with Chriſt the head of the Covenant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. <hi>If you be Chriſts, you are Abrahams ſeed, and heirs alſo of the promiſe:</hi> ſo that as there is not a new Covenant made with every man that is born into the world, but the old Covenant made with <hi>Adam</hi> in his Creation ſtands ſtill in force, only (as ſoon as a man is born and becomes a man, he is one with the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and is ſo reckoned and counted by God, as under this repreſentative head;) ſo there is not a new Covenant made with every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, for they all come under <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant, and <hi>Davids</hi> Covenant, even the ſame Covenant that was made with Chriſt, only they become one with him as members of his body, and ſo they are repreſented and counted by God as under this head, and ſo under this Covenant; therefore in Converſion there is a double change. (1) <hi>Moralis,</hi> moral, which is a change of a mans Covenant, becauſe there is a change of a mans head; and then (2) <hi>Realis,</hi> real, or a change of a mans Image, becauſe there is a change of a mans ſpirit, and a man receives another ſpirit different from the ſpirit of this world: but then there is this difference, Our Union with the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> is <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>neceſſary,</hi> we being originally contained, and ſeminally repreſented in him; but the other is <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary</hi> and by <hi>conſent,</hi> as between a man and his ſurety, who are one <hi>in conſpectu fori, in legal account,</hi> by the mutual conſent of both parties. Chriſt out of his free love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to repreſent us, and we by an Almighty Power (the Spirit of God giving an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual power to the will), conſent unto Chriſt to be one with him, and to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto God by him: ſo then, as Chriſt has the preheminence in all other things, as he is firſt elected, and we in him; ſo he is <hi>primus foederatus, the firſt federate,</hi> and we in him, and no otherwiſe in the Covenant but as we are one with him: for if there be a Covenant made between two, and yet afterwards another by conſent of parties be taken into the ſame Covenant; it muſt be granted, that he was not firſt in the Covenant, but came in by conſent, and at ſecond hand.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In whom the righteouſneſs of the Covenant is, with him primarily the Covenant was made; but the righteouſneſs of the Covenant is to be found in Chriſt alone; he is made unto us of God,<note place="margin">Jer. 23.6. 1 Cor. 1.30. Heb. 7.22.</note> Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redemption, and therefore he is the ſurety of the Covenant: he is one that did ſtrike hands with the Lord, and did ingage himſelf for our debt. Now in a ſuretiſhip there are two things: (1) The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal one that is chiefly bound to pay the debt, and of whom in a legal way the creditor will expect it. 2. In caſe of failure of the party, the ſurety is engaged for it as truly as if it were his own: now in the firſt reſpect Chriſt is not ſo properly a ſurety, for God did never make a Covenant with Chriſt with any intention to exact or expect any thing of us:<note place="margin">Pſal. 89.9.</note> 
                     <hi>but I have laid help upon one that is mighty,</hi> which is a word often uſed of Chriſt: he is called the <hi>mighty God,</hi> Iſa. 9.6. and Pſal. 45.3. <hi>Gird thy ſword O moſt mighty;</hi> as if the Lord had ſaid, I know that theſe will fail me, and are every way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52030:85"/> to pay, therefore I will lay it upon a ſubſtantial perſon, one that has ability to give me ſatisfaction, and of him will I expect the debt. But in the ſecond reſpect it is, that Chriſt is ſaid to be the ſurety, as one that has undertaken to pay in our ſtead what we were never able, neither could it be expected from us; Chriſt became a ſurety of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Covenant and every part thereof, he did not only undertake to ſatisfie God in his Law and Juſtice, both in reference to the Precept and the Curſe that all lay upon him as his debt, he being made ſin for us, and a curſe for us, and we by the imputation of it as being in him are excepted from it; for in his juſtification we were juſtified alſo; for he died as the ſurety of the Covenant, and ſo he roſe, and therefore is ſaid, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>to be juſtified in the ſpirit:</hi> as he is ſaid to be <hi>quickened in the ſpirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. Heb. 9.14.</note> 
                     <hi>to offer himſelf by the eternal ſpirit of the godhead;</hi> and being raiſed thereby, he is ſaid in his reſurrection to be juſtified, becauſe that did declare that the debt was paid; and therefore God ſent an Angel as a publick Officer and Miniſter of juſtice to roll away the Stone, and to let him out of Priſon, and therefore, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. the Apoſtle doth reaſon from the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt, that if he be not riſen, we are yet in our ſins, but Chriſt being riſen, and thereby juſtified, we alſo are juſtified and accepted, becauſe that did declare that the debt was paid by our ſurety, and he receiving a diſcharge, in him we are diſcharged alſo: Moreover, as the ſurety of the Covenant, he hath not only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to pay our debt, but alſo to work in us whatever God <hi>requires</hi> of us ſhould be done by us in the Covenant of Grace; ſo <hi>Pareus</hi> ſays, he was a ſurety, <hi>ſpondens Deo populi nomine fidem &amp; obedientiam:</hi> So that the righteouſneſs of the Covenant being only to be found in him, and to be made ours by imputation, and a gracious acceptation, as we are one with him; thence it doth plainly appear, that the Covenant is made with him in the firſt place, and we come to have an intereſt in the everlaſting righteouſneſs of it at ſecond hand, as we are one with him; and ſo we are <hi>made the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. <hi>laſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>But is not the righteouſneſs of the Covenant required of us alſo?</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, that perfect obedience in nature and life is required of us, as well as of <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of innocency, and ſo far as we come ſhort of it, we ſin; but yet in the Covenant of Grace it is not required as the righteouſneſs of the Covenant, and as that righteouſneſs by which I am to ſtand righteous before God, (as afflictions in the Covenant of Grace, are not laid upon the Saints for ſatisfaction to God, but for correction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) but it is required and that perfectly, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. <hi>That we ſhould cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs, and perfect holineſs in the fear of God,</hi> to manifeſt the truth of our union with Chriſt. The branch cannot bear fruit of it ſelf;<note place="margin">Joh. 15.5.</note> 
                     <hi>without me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>you can do nothing;</hi> and you do hereby manifeſt that you are one with me: As <hi>James</hi> 2.24. <hi>Abraham was juſtified by works;</hi> according to <hi>James,</hi> a man is juſtified not by Faith only, and yet <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that a man is juſtified by Faith alone, without the works of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>A mans faith doth juſtifie his perſon before God, and a mans works do juſtifie his faith before men,</hi> and it is that we may ſhew forth the vertues of him that hath called us,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.9.</note> and that it may appear that our union with Chriſt is not a notion, and no more, but that it is real and powerful; and our Faith is lively, becauſe it is a working Faith; and this righteouſneſs now imputed unto us, as we are in him, he will never leave till he hath perfected in us, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.27. <hi>That he may preſent us unto himſelf without ſpot or wrinkle;</hi> this is a work that he hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken unto his Father, but yet ſo as the righteouſneſs of the Covenant is to be found in him alone, and made to be imputed only as we are one with him in Gods account and acceptation; ſo that ſtill the Covenant is made with him primarily, becauſe in him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the righteouſneſs of the Covenant is to be found, and comes unto us at ſecond hand.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. All the promiſes of the Covenant are made unto him primarily, and unto us only at ſecond hand, and as we are one with him; they are made firſt unto him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are called the <hi>ſure mercies of David,</hi> and Epheſ. 1.3.<note place="margin">Iſa. 55.3.</note> 
                     <hi>God has bleſſed us with all ſpiritual mercies in heavenly places in Chriſt:</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. they are made <hi>in him,</hi> that is, unto us as we are in him, and ſo they are accompliſhed: If the promiſes of God were by deed of gift only from the free grace of God, they might be made unto us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, for God may give to whom he will; but they are all of them a jointure, or an endowment upon a Marriage, which can neither be either rationally or legally claimed without an intereſt in the perſon. All the Promiſes are as the lines and circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, they all meet in union with Chriſt as the center; for they are all made unto Chriſt, and unto us only ſo far as we are members of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>laſt.</hi> Being Chriſts we are become heirs of the Promiſe, and no otherwiſe. God deals with a people
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52030:86"/> in this, as a Father takes an inheritance of a Child in his infancy, or it may be unborn, and he keeps it in his own hands for him till he comes to years, and then puts him into poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion thereof: So it is with the Saints, they are maintained a long time in the womb of Gods election, before they are brought forth in a work of calling and regeneration; and being called, they are not capable of receiving of many of the promiſes, they are in their infancy, but yet theſe promiſes are conveyed from God to Chriſt as an inheritance, which he receives as a publick perſon, a common Father in their behalf, which in Gods time he will put them alſo in poſſeſſion of.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. All the graces of the Covenant be firſt beſtowed upon him: The Spirit, as the Oil, is poured firſt upon the head, and afterwards it runs down upon the skirts of his garments, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.2. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.7. <hi>He is anointed with the oil of gladneſs above his fellows,</hi> and 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.20. <hi>We receive an unction from the holy one;</hi> Joh. 1.16. <hi>Of his fulneſs we receive grace for grace.</hi> 1 Joh. 5.11. <hi>God has given us eternal life, and that life is in his ſon:</hi> It is laid up in him as in a common treaſury, even the whole Image of God, that he doth intend to beſtow upon us in grace and glory, it is given unto us, and laid up in him for us, but yet it is in him, and not in us; he has received the ſpirit without meaſure, he is the Son of righteouſneſs,<note place="margin">Iſa. 6.57.</note> and our healing is in his wings. There are, as you may ſee, three ſteps or degrees of conveyance in this life, (1) <hi>The living Father as the fountain.</hi> (2) Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I live by the Father.</hi> And it is given him to have life in himſelf, as the chanel or way of conveyance. (3) <hi>You live by me:</hi> All the graces of the Covenant do actually belong unto him, and unto us, as we are one with him, and therefore it is commonly called the <hi>grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as that which is originally in him, as in the fountain or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and conveyed unto us only by union; as we are members of his body, ſo we have an influence from him as the head, and no otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. All the priviledges of the Covenant do primarily belong to him, and unto us only as we are in him; he is the Son, and from him we receive power to become the Sons of God; he is the heir,<note place="margin">Jo. 1.12. Pſal. 8.4. Heb. 2.</note> and we co-heirs with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. <hi>He has put all things under his feet, all ſheep and oxen, &amp;c.</hi> This is ſpoken primarily and principally of the man Chriſt Jeſus, he is called Gods ſervant, and in him we are ſervants alſo; he is a King and a Prieſt, and we are made by him Kings and Prieſts unto God the Father, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. he is the firſt beloved, and we in him; he firſt accepted, and we in him; he firſt juſtified, and we in him; he firſt overcomes, and we in him; we overcome by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of our Teſtimony; we ſit together in heavenly places: He judges the world, and we in him; and when we come to Heaven, we ſhall but enter into our Maſters joy. Thus every thing that concerns the Covenant belongs firſt unto him, and then unto us; and therefore we may ſafely conclude, that the Covenant made with the Saints of Chriſt, it is with Chriſt prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and principally, and with us at ſecond hand.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Laſtly, the great and principal reſpect that God hath in this Covenant is to him alone, and unto us only as we are in him, in all the tranſactions of the Covenant. (1) In all the ſervice that we tender unto God, by vertue of this Covenant, God doth not prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily reſpect it as it comes from us, but as it comes from Chriſt, as <hi>fruit in him, Joh.</hi> 15.2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. as the Lord doth not meerly make that a ground; for Chriſt ſays, <hi>I do not ſay that I will pray the father for you,</hi>

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52030:86" rendition="simple:additions"/> the way how the ends of Gods electing love ſhould be effected. Now the ends of Gods electing love are (1) The praiſe of the glory of his Grace. (2) The glory of his Son. (3) The holineſs and happineſs of the Saints. Theſe ends are ſuitably accompliſhed by this Covenant, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3, 4, 5.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.3, 4, 5.</note> 
                     <hi>He has bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly things in Chriſt, according as he has choſen us in him.</hi> Here three things are obſervable, (1) It is ſpoken of Chriſt as Mediator, as God-man; for in him we are bleſſed, in him we are choſen; but our bleſſings proceed from Chriſt as Mediator. (2) The order of the election, we are <hi>choſen in him,</hi> that is in him as the head; and therefore he is firſt elected, as he is firſt beloved: <hi>In whom I am well pleaſed;</hi> well pleaſed with his people,<note place="margin">Matt. 3.17.</note> all the members of Chriſt, but firſt with Chriſt, and with them only as they are in him, and one with him. (3) According to this order, ſo are all the bleſſings of the Covenant of Grace diſpenſed; for he hath bleſſed us in him, as he hath choſen us in him; according to the order of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſuch is the order alſo of benediction: Now the bleſſing of the Covenant of Grace being only in purſuance of the Election of God, the Order of God therein muſt be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Election, which is firſt of Chriſt, and afterwards of all the Saints of God in him. It's true, there is but one Election, as there is but one Covenant; but yet there is an Order in Election, as well as there is in the Covenant; firſt Chriſt is elected, and we in him; as the Lord entred into Covenant firſt with him, and with us in him as a head. Here conſider [1] that the great and the higheſt end of the counſel of God in Election next unto his own glory, was the glory of his Son; for this is the Order of God, that the Father may be glorified in his Son, and the Son glorified in the Saints; and in the laſt day Chriſt ſhall be <hi>admired in them that believe,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10. and that in the glory of Chriſt God the Father may be glorified, and that God may be all in all, when the Son alſo is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to him.

                     <note place="margin">Col. 1.15.</note> which I conceive not to be ſpoken ſimply of Chriſt as God, but as Mediator; it is ſaid before, <hi>that he is the image of the inviſible God:</hi> If it be ſpoken of him as God, then he is equally inviſible with the Father; but as Mediator in whom all the glorious Attributes of God do ſhine forth, ſo he is the Image of God; and ſo I conceive it to refer to the Election of Chriſt, as being Jeſus the firſt-born in the womb of Election; the like unto that is <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in the firſt going forth in his Decrees towards the creature, therefore Chriſt was firſt elected; and the higheſt ends of God in the counſels of Election, next unto the glory of himſelf, was the glory of his Son. [2] This glory of the Son he doth intend to accompliſh two ways. (1) He will in the fulleſt manner communicate himſelf to the Son, he will in the higheſt way delight in him; there could not be towards any creature the fulleſt communication and communion, becauſe all communion is founded in union, and the higher the union, the more glorious the communication: Now between God and the creature there was a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural union, as between the cauſe and the effect; and there was a voluntary union by Covenant; and anſwerable to theſe was the communication of God to the creature either <hi>ordine naturae,</hi> or <hi>gratiae;</hi> but yet there being a higher union, this muſt make way for a higher communication; and therefore God intending to communicate himſelf to his Son in the higheſt way, he doth firſt in order priviledge him to be perſonally united to a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nature, and in this nature he can take full delight, which he could not do in any meer creature whatſoever; for the more of God is in any creature, the more God can delight in it; and the leſs of God, the leſs delight: Now it is only in Chriſt, that the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Godhead doth bodily dwell, and he is his Image, therefore there can be a full delight in none but in him; he <hi>charges his Angels with folly,</hi> not with actual but poſſible folly, but yet the humane nature of Chriſt is impeccable by reaſon of its union; for <hi>actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſunt ſuppoſiti,</hi> and therefore in him he takes full delight.<note place="margin">Iſa. 42.1.</note> (2) God did intend to glorifie his Son, by making him the fountain of all that goodneſs and glory that ever he did intend to beſtow upon the creatures, that he ſhould be a fountain of all good unto the creature upon whom he ſet his love, ſutable unto their condition and neceſſity. [1] If the elect Angels retain their integrity and keep their firſt habitation, abide in the truth, Chriſt ſhould be to them <hi>medium confirmationis.</hi> [2] If man be fallen, he ſhall become unto him <hi>medium reconciliationis.</hi> And this I conceive to be the Order of the Election of God, he doth chuſe Chriſt as the perſon to whom he will in the fulleſt manner communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himſelf, and in whom he will glorifie himſelf in the higheſt way, and as that perſon that ſhall be the fountain of all good to the creature ſutably unto their neceſſity and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whatever they be; if they ſtand, to confirm them, if they fall, to repair them: And ſo he was firſt choſen and elected, and they in him as in their head; and ſo the Lamb hath a

(1) To appoint the creature an end, and to give it a Law, which may bring it unto this end. (2) That this Law every creature is bound to obey, and yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to, from his own election and choice: For it muſt be reaſonable ſervice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. and a man muſt chuſe the way of truth. (3) That every aberration or deviation from this will of the Creator, hath an evil and an iniquity in it, being an undue act, that doth <hi>intrinſically</hi> carry with it great obligation to puniſhment. (4) That the ſame Law-giver that hath power to give the Law, hath alſo power to threaten, and inflict a Curſe, and puniſhment for the tranſgreſſion of that Law. (5) Mans ſin being wilfull, (a choſen tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion) the puniſhment whereof he was before inſtructed in, he doth moſt juſtly bring himſelf under that Curſe and puniſhment that God had threatned upon ſuch a tranſgreſſion: For God was his judge, having given him a Law; as before he was his Creator, in giving him a being: he was ſubject to his will, as his Creator; and was ſubject to his ſentence, as his Judge. (6) This ſin God could not ſuffer to go unpuniſhed.

It was ſtrange if that which did provoke the juſtice of God unto the execution of the Law, ſhould procure the abrogation of the Law; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here is only place for a puniſhment to be inflicted, but none for a Covenant to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, without a Mediator: For the old Covenant is broken, and till there be a way found to ſatisfie the Curſe of the firſt Covenant, there can be no place for a ſecond. Now this ſatisfaction muſt be in our ſelves, or in ſome other that ſhall undertake it, by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and acceptation of God in our behalf. In our ſelves it is impoſſible, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of a Soul is ſo great; for whatever man can do for time to come, is but a debt; and to pay a debt or ſervice that we owe at preſent, will not ſatisfie for a debt that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted before; and the demerit of ſin is infinite, being againſt an infinite God; infinite glory is debaſed, and infinite juſtice deſpiſed; and man is but finite in his being, and his ſervices are all but finite, and between finite and infinite there can be no proportion; therefore there can be no ſatisfaction; for ſatisfaction is that which is <hi>equivalent, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore if the Lord will be ſatisfied, it cannot be in a mans ſelf, therefore it muſt be in a Mediator:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.6.</note> And whereas there is a double need of a Mediator, one of <hi>Interceſſion,</hi> and the other of <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> there is ſuch a one required; and ſo was Chriſt.

Thus God could not enter into Covenant with man immediately, but it muſt be by a Mediator, that ſhould bear the Curſe, and ſatisfie the Covenant. 2. This Curſe being born, and ſatisfaction being made, God could not enter into Covenant with man immediately in the ſecond Covenant, for he did intend it ſhould be an everlaſting Covenant, that by which all the elect ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 23.5.</note>

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52030:87"/> If the Lord ſhould have received a ſatisfaction for his ſin in Chriſt, and afterwards left him in the hand of his own Counſels, man would have immediately brought himſelf into the ſame condition, and would have had great need of a new ſatisfaction, and ſo Chriſt might have ſuffered often, and have become, as the beaſts were, a daily ſacrifice; therefore Chriſt is called <hi>the ſurety of the better Covenant,</hi>

This doth exceedingly advance the grace of the Second Covenant: for God to enter into Covenant with man after his fall and breach of his firſt Covenant was a great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and to be taken into the ſame Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> was a great mercy; but it is one of the higheſt mercies,<note place="margin">Iſa. 49.9.</note> that Chriſt is given as a Covenant, to ſtand under the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the Son of God. (1) Under all bleſſings, whatever we receive, we receive not apart from Chriſt, but as one with him; we are juſtified by his righteouſneſs, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his ſpirit, receive his Image here, and in Heaven we enter into our Maſters joy; all not apart from him, but as one with him. (2) All the bleſſings of the Covenant we may claim in Chriſts right, by vertue of the Covenant made with him for us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<note place="margin">Joh. 20.17. Joh. 1.12.</note> 
                     <hi>to as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God; even to them that believe in his name.</hi> And <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.17. <hi>For the Lords ſake;</hi> for the Covenant is the ſame between God and Chriſt, that is between God and us. (3) We perform all the duties of the Covenant as accepted in the perſon of Chriſt; the Lord receives them all from the hand of Chriſt, who is ingaged by Covenant to perform them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.8. <hi>In him is all our fruit found.</hi> And therefore, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.2. it is <hi>bearing fruit in him,</hi> and they are received as they come out of the Angels hand: All our obedience is looked upon by God as the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt, and all our ſufferings as the ſufferings of Chriſt unto this day; all our hope is in our head.</p>
                  <p n="6">6thly. From the great inconveniences that muſt needs follow upon the Doctrine, that the Covenant ſhould be firſt made with us, and Chriſt only come in but at ſecond hand to make up our defects. (1) Thereby Chriſt ſhould in a great meaſure loſe the glory of his head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; for if it be an honour to Chriſt to be a Head by receiving an Image, then it is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour alſo firſt to receive a Covenant,<note place="margin">Col. 2.19.</note> as it was of the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi> It is as great a ſin, and therefore muſt needs be as dangerous a Doctrine, to look unto our ſelves only for a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as it is to look into our ſelves only for an Image. (2) This will in a great meaſure take away the ground of our communion with Chriſt. 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 1.3. our fellowſhip is with him, we have a communion with Chriſt in his righteouſneſs, priviledges and victories; and the ground of this communion is only the Covenant: We have communion with <hi>Adam</hi> in his ſin and curſe, becauſe the <hi>hand-writing</hi> of our Fathers is ours; ſo the ground of our
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52030:88"/> communion with Chriſt in his righteouſneſs is, as he is a repreſentative head, and as we come under his Covenant; and therefore his obedience is ours, his ſufferings ours, we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered with him, we died in him, riſe with him, becauſe we are under the ſame Covenant with him. (3) In this does the ſtability of the Covenant of Grace lye, it is an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant and unchangeable, becauſe it is made with an unchangeable head: <hi>Adams</hi> Covenant, and ſo that of the Angels was ſubject to change, becauſe the perſons were changeable with whom the Covenant was made; if the Covenant were primarily made with us, then our unfaithfulneſs might break the Covenant, as <hi>Adams</hi> did; but our Image is not blotted out by our ſins, as <hi>Adams</hi> was; becauſe the fountain of it is not within us,<note place="margin">1 Jo. 5.1.</note> but in another; and he hath ſaid, <hi>becauſe I live, you ſhall live;</hi> ſo our unfaithfulneſs makes not the Covenant void, becauſe it is not made with us, but with him, and with us in him; and becauſe he keeps the Covenant, it muſt needs remain ſure to all the ſeed; ſo that as our ſins blot not out our Image, ſo they break not the Covenant, becauſe Chriſt is the root and the head in the one as well as in the other: and ſo it is every way more honourable for Chriſt, and comfortable for us, that the Covenant ſhould be made with him, and he be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon upon whom the principal ingagement ſhould lye, and upon us in the ſecond place; that ſo, though we be unfaithful, yet the Covenant may remain ſure, rather than to bring in Chriſt in this Covenant but as our ſurety and ſervant barely to ſupply our defects.</p>

(2) As it is an act of ſpecial grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy unto us. (1) As it is an honour done to him, and ſo the firſt promiſe of giving Chriſt is made to Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6. the Lord doth promiſe to <hi>give him as a Covenant to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> For the Lords intention was from eternity, to glorifie his Son, and to exalt him as the Prince of the ſecond Covenant; for Gods intention was to glorifie himſelf in Chriſt two ways. [1] In a way of <hi>meer grace,</hi> by conferring upon his humane nature, the higheſt honour and excellency that a created nature was capable of by the perſonal union with the Godhead; which Divines commonly call <hi>gratia unionis,</hi> the grace of Union, that thereby there might be the fulleſt communication of the Godhead upon him, and the higheſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency and delight in him. [2] In a way of <hi>reward.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 2.7, 8.</note> [1] As a reward of his own o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience unto the will of his Father, therefore God hath highly exalted him. [2] As a reward of his ſufferings for his members; for by the acceptation of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt for them, and imputing it unto them, Chriſt is rewarded, by whom they have acceſs with boldneſs to the throne of Grace; which though it be juſtice unto Chriſt, yet it is mercy unto us: And thus will the Lord make Chriſt the fountain of all good unto his elect, and this is as you have heard, firſt promiſed unto him, that the Lord will prepare him a body, give him a humane nature, take him into perſonal Union with himſelf, and in that nature give him unto man with a Covenant and an Image; and ſo the giving of Chriſt is by promiſe, firſt made unto him, and his coming in the fleſh is but the fulfilling and the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of this promiſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:52030:89"/>(2) We may conſider it as an act of ſpecial grace and mercy unto us, and ſo <hi>to us, Iſa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>a ſon is born, and to us a child is given:</hi> So he is the promiſed ſeed unto the Saints, that promiſe which all the Saints of old lived in expectation of, that waited for the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> ſo the giving of Chriſt unto the World, is by promiſe made unto the Saints; and ſo the giving of Chriſt unto the Saints, hath its foundation laid in a promiſe made unto Chriſt, to give him as an head, with a Covenant and an Image; and having promiſed this unto Chriſt, now he adds a promiſe unto the Saints, that he would give him ſo unto them, as the work of vocation in bringing of ſouls home unto Chriſt. It is not ſo properly and formally a promiſe made to us, as it is to Chriſt, <hi>That God would let him ſee his ſeed, and prolong his days upon earth, and give him the heathen for his inheritance, &amp;c.</hi> and all in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of that antient Covenant between the Father and the Son, when he did agree with him for all the elect, and chuſe them in him as their head; and all that is done in time is the fulfilling of what the Father did promiſe the Son, and they come unto us only at ſecond hand, as we are looked upon as one with Chriſt; and ſo the Lord giving us unto Chriſt, and Chriſt unto us, and we being apprehended of him, he gives us faith to apprehend him again. So it is in this, but ſo, that the very giving of Chriſt is by promiſe made firſt unto Chriſt, and then unto us, as the other great promiſes are, <hi>I will be thy God;</hi> he is firſt Chriſts God, and then our God, and he is his God as Mediatour no way but by Covenant, and our God in him. <hi>And I will ſend my ſpirit;</hi> he hath the promiſe firſt made to him to receive it in its fullneſs, and diſpenſe it, and it is conveyed unto us only as we are one with him our head. So the promiſe of Chriſt alſo is made unto him firſt as a point of ſpecial ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and unto us as a ſpecial favour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the other ſort of promiſes of pardoning of ſin, giving grace and repentance, they are made firſt unto Chriſt, as the price of his blood, and part of his purchaſe, and of that reward that the Lord did intend to beſtow upon him; for God gives no ſouls to Chriſt but thoſe that he hath purchaſed; and beſtows no grace upon them, but it is done unto Chriſt as a reward of his purchaſe, and ſervice, and as a perfecting of his myſtical body, till they come unto the fulneſs of the age of the ſtature of Chriſt; for the Church it ſelf is a <hi>purchaſed poſſeſſion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 20.18.</note> whether it be in grace or glory; and therefore Chriſt looks upon all graces, and all priviledges, as part of his due from God the Father, and that they ſhould be beſtowed upon them for whom he laid down a price. And therefore we read that though Chriſt, while he was upon earth, was a man of ſorrows, and had little comfort in this World; yet he did take delight in this, the fulfilling of the promiſes unto him in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Souls, and perfecting Saints. When the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> was converted, he ſaid,<note place="margin">Luk. 16.20.</note> 
                     <hi>'Twas his meat and drink to do the will of his father,</hi> he rejoyced in ſpirit that ſouls were converted, and that the myſteries of the Goſpel were revealed unto babes. And <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.15. when he called <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the Grave, they ſaid, <hi>he is dead,</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>I was glad for your ſakes, to this end that you might believe;</hi> he rejoiceth that there was an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to add unto their faith, and that it might grow and increaſe one degree more: It was the joy of his heart to ſee of the travel of his ſoul.<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.</note> And there are three things that Chriſt hath reſpect unto herein. [1] His ſufferings paſt, and therefore he doth in his interceſſion always ſprinkle his blood before the mercy ſeat, his blood is a ſpeaking blood, he hath laid down the price, and therefore ſurely he expects the purchaſe. [2] It is the joy of his heart now he is in Heaven, to ſee the graces of his people grow and flouriſh, it is the meat that he is ſaid to ſeed upon, as we ſee <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2. <hi>I have mingled my wine with my milk, and eat my honey, &amp;c. and thou art the faireſt amongſt women, thou haſt raviſhed me with one of thine eyes; &amp;c.</hi> It's a joy to the Angels when a ſoul is converted; and a joy to the Miniſters, the Angels upon earth, when they grow in grace, and ſtand faſt in the faith: And if the ſervants and children of the Bridegroom rejoyce in it, how much doth the Bridegroom him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf rejoyce in it? [3] In reference to the glory that is to come, at the day of Judgement he comes <hi>to be admired in his ſaints,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 1.</note> and afterwards he doth preſent the Church unto God the Father; which ſome conceive to be the giving up of his Kingdom, that <hi>God may be all in all;</hi> and he ſhall have an eternal glory that ſhall be reflexed upon him from the Saints, who ſhall ſing for ever <hi>hallelujah</hi> unto him, who is the head and King of Saints: Therefore all theſe promiſes are made firſt unto him, and do principally belong unto him, and he is moſt concerned in them, that if they be not fulfilled he ſhall be the greateſt loſer by them, loſe his ſufferings paſt, and his delight for the preſent, and his glory to come; ſo that in the performance of them, God hath a ſpecial reſpect to Chriſt, and they belong unto us, and are fulfilled unto us only as we are in Chriſt, and no otherways. 2. There is in theſe promiſes an <hi>active</hi> and a <hi>paſſive,</hi> a giving and a receiving; (1) They are made unto Chriſt as the giver, and unto us only as thoſe that muſt receive all things from him, the Oil is pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firſt upon his head;<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.</note> and <hi>the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand; of his fulneſs
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52030:89"/> we receive grace for grace; he hath given him power over-all fleſh,</hi>

(2) The <hi>paſſive</hi> part of theſe belong unto the Saints, but it is as they are one with him, and as they have an intereſt in all this grace received by their head, that it may by him be diſpenſed unto them; for 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.11. he hath laid up all their life in him, for all the promiſes are made unto his ſeed, though in a different order, and in different reſpects, ſome promiſes made formally to him, and ſome promiſes fulfilled in his members.</p>

(2) But when this Covenant was to take place, Chriſt finds all mankind under the Covenant of their Creation, and that broken, and they brought under the curſe of it; and now the Covenant of Grace cannot take place, unleſs he will come under the firſt Covenant, and thereby aboliſh it; the ſin againſt the firſt Covenant could never be pardoned, unleſs he be made ſin; and the curſe of the firſt Covenant could never be ſatisfied, unleſs he be made a Curſe; and the Covenant it ſelf never aboliſhed for any, unleſs he be made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law as a Covenant, that they may be tranſlated, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5.

We were firſt ſin, and he was made ſin for us; we a curſe firſt, and he made a curſe for us; ſo we were firſt under the Covenant of Works, and he did freely ſubject himſelf to be made under the Law: he took our nature, that he might communicate his to us; ſo he takes our Covenant, and ſubjects himſelf to it, that he might impart unto us his Covenant, and bring that into the World.

                  <p n="1">1ſt. It is a free gift; there are three things in a gift, (1) It is not <hi>ex debito,</hi> of debt, God did not owe unto man a Covenant, it was all free grace, it was that made him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a Covenant at firſt, barely to ſweeten mans obedience; and therefore that man might be willing to be bound to obey, God himſelf is content to be bound to reward him: But when man had broken the firſt Covenant, and was perfidious before God, now to enter into a ſecond Covenant, this makes the Grace of God the greater, becauſe otherwiſe he ſhould have periſhed under the curſe of the firſt. (2) It is not <hi>ex pretio,</hi> by price; there is no price, that did purchaſe the Covenant; though all the benefits and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the Covenant are purchaſed by Chriſt, yet the Covenant it ſelf is grounded only upon free grace; and it is this Covenant that is the ground of all the acts of Chriſt, and the acceptation of them all is grounded only upon free Grace in the Covenant and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact between him and his Father. (3) Not <hi>ex merito,</hi> of merit, from any thing that we can do; for there is not the leaſt bleſſing in the ſecond Covenant but it is of Grace, and <hi>the reward is not reckoned of debt, but of grace;</hi> and if all the benefits of the Covenant be ſo, much more the Covenant it ſelf, from whence comes all the grace we have to do any thing pleaſing in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. The greatneſs of the gift is ſeen in the love of the giver. There was a love mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the firſt Covenant; but yet it was not ſuch by which he did intend that any of the Sons of men ſhould be ſaved: He has ſaid, <hi>That by the works of the law ſhall no man be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified; and the inheritance is not by the law, &amp;c.</hi> But the ſecond Covenant did proceed from Gods electing love, which is exactly ſuited thereunto; for <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3, 4. he doth obſerve the ſame order in the <hi>benediction,</hi> that he did in <hi>election:</hi> And the more difficulties love breaks through, the greater it is, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.7. Now our Covenant-breaking might provoke God to withdraw his love; and yet the greatneſs of his love is ſeen in the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: The firſt Covenant was broken, and thereby that love was turned into hatred, and God became our enemy, as <hi>common love will end in everlaſting hatred;</hi> but this is from his everlaſting love, and therefore it is an everlaſting Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly. The greatneſs of it is ſeen in our neceſſity. We were (1) under a Covenant bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and therefore under the curſe of it. (2) It was a Covenant without a Mediator; for God could not enter into Covenant immediately with us being fallen, as we have heard at large; therefore there was in the firſt Covenant no commutation of the perſon; we muſt anſwer for it in our own perſons; <hi>the ſoul that ſins, muſt dye.</hi> (3) A Covenant that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes no ſpark of repentance. (4) A Covenant that promiſes no mercy or acceptance upon repentance; and therefore man had been left in a remedileſs condition, even as the Devil at this day,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.4.</note> being bound in the <hi>chains of darkneſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. which is nothing elſe but the curſe of their Covenant.

That Chriſt is given as a Covenant, doth heighten the promiſes thereof, and make them of a far more glorious nature,<note place="margin">Rev. 21.7.</note> than thoſe under the firſt Covenant: For <hi>I will be thy God, and thou ſhalt have an intereſt in all that is in me for thy good;</hi> as truly as it is mine for my own glory: The promiſes are infinitely heightned, becauſe he that is the Prince of the Covenant was worthy and capable, which no meer creature could be.</p>
                  <p n="6">6thly. This makes the promiſes of it ſure unto all the ſeed; for with Chriſt, God cannot break Covenant; and there is nothing in this Covenant but is purchaſed as well as promiſed; and the righteouſneſs is everlaſting, ſin can never ſpend it: <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Surety of a better teſtament:</hi> A ſurety not only of the old Covenant to pay the debt, but alſo of the new to perform the duty; ſo that God expects all from him, and accepts all as it doth proceed from his hand.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This inſtructs us alſo that we are to admire, honour, and exalt the Lord Jeſus, given as a Covenant to the Nations; 1ſt. That he would conſent thereunto; for whatever Chriſt is made for us, and whatſoever he is given to us, is by his own conſent; and there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of his will with God the Father's therein; for as he is the Son, he is God equal
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52030:90" rendition="simple:additions"/> with the Father, and <hi>thought it no robbery ſo to be;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 2.7, 8.</note> and therefore he cannot come under an act of Gods will, but by his own conſent; whence in the very election of Chriſt, there is a concurrence of the will of Chriſt unto it; <hi>Chriſts generation is an act of nature, but his election is an act of will;</hi> and as Chriſt is God, he cannot come under an act of Gods will, without his own conſent: He is ſaid, <hi>to be foreknown,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.20. Heb. 1.2.</note> 
                     <hi>and foreordained before the world began;</hi> and <hi>to be appointed heir of all things:</hi> God having an abſolute dominion over us, we being in his hand, as clay in the hand of a Potter, our election is meerly an act of his ſovereignty, God having abſolute power to appoint us to what end he will, as well as to give us what being he will: but it is not ſo in the election of Chriſt, nor in any of the conſequents of his election, he coming not under an act of Gods will but by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Hence, that Chriſt ſhould come under this Covenant, and be made a Covenant unto us, doth exceedingly exalt the Lord Jeſus. We look upon it as a great condeſcenſion in God the Father, that when he had made his creature he would be bound to him, and not only be his God by creation, but alſo by ſtipulation; <hi>he pays debts that owes none, he forgives debts as not valuing them:</hi> But the condeſcenſion of Chriſt is exceeding great, to enter into Covenant by way of obedience and ſubjection; and this honours God more than the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of all the creatures in Heaven and Earth, that his Son ſhould be in ſubjection to him; and this honours the Law more than any thing elſe, that he that is the Lord of the Law, ſhould be made under the Law; and that he that was equal with God in nature, ſhould come under the counſel of his will; it is much more than for all the creatures to obey him, that did owe all that they were by the right of their creation: for all the Stars to vail their faces before the Son, it's nothing; but for one Sun to be willing to be Eclipſed, that the other may ſhine: for all the Subjects in Kingdom to ſerve a Prince is nothing, but for a Prince equal with himſelf in ſtate and honour, to come and be a Servant and wait upon him on his knees, and be at his command, honours him more.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. That hereby you ſhould have the benefit of this eternal tranſaction between the Father and the Son before the World began, and of that mutual agreement that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; for the whole Covenant was in reference unto you: Chriſt came into the World under an ingagement, and therefore he ſaith, <hi>Lo I come to do thy will;</hi> and the Lord calls him his <hi>Servant, I will bring forth my righteous ſervant the branch, and by his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many;</hi> and it was a ſervice undertaken and conſented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and that which he was <hi>appointed before the world began,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20.<note place="margin">Titus 1.2. 2 Tim. 1.9.</note> And of this I conceive theſe places of Scripture are to be underſtood: <hi>John</hi> 17.6. <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them unto me:</hi> And <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.8. <hi>And all that dwell upon the earth ſhall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, whoſe names are not writen in the lambs book, &amp;c.</hi> It cannot be ſpoken of election, for though election being an act <hi>ad extra,</hi> is common unto all the perſons, and therefore the Son and Spirit had a hand in the choice, as well as the Father; <hi>I know whom I have choſen;</hi> yet that is an act of Chriſt as God, but this is ſpoken of him as he is the Mediator: as he is the Lamb, ſo he hath a <hi>Book of life,</hi> which can be underſtood no otherwiſe, but in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto the Covenant that the Lord did work with him as Mediator, and in reference to the Souls that the Lord did then indent with him for to ſave, all thoſe that he had choſen unto life, that were in the Covenant between Chriſt and him, and he did give unto Chriſt by Covenant, and Chriſt did therein tranſcribe their names out of the Lords Book of election into the Lambs Book, which is a meer tranſcript of the Father's Book of life: And thus you have the benefit of this great tranſaction between the Father and the Son, by vertue of this Covenant; and thereby you become part of Chriſts care, and have your names written in his heart, from all eternity, and thereby have, as it were, a being in Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you had a being in your ſelves; he bore you in his boſom, had your names in his Book before the World was.</p>

Hence believers ſhould learn to know their place and ſtation under the ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that they come in only as acceſſories into this Covenant, only at ſecond hand, under the grace, and favour, and acceptance of another, and no otherwiſe. We commonly, through our ignorance of the Covenant of Grace, do think, that when the firſt Covenant was broken, Chriſt did come and pay the debt, and ſatisfie the Curſe for us, and as a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, did procure God to make a new Covenant with us, as if we were the perſons with whom this Covenant was made, and to whom the grace, mercies, priviledges and promiſes of the Covenant do belong; only Chriſt as Mediator, by ſatisfying of the debt of the firſt Covenant, and taking it away, did procure it for us: But we are herein utterly miſtaken, for he hath ſo brought in, a ſecond Covenant, that he himſelf is the <hi>primus foederatus,</hi> the firſt federate therein, and hath the ſame place as the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> that the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had in the firſt Covenant; it was made primarily with him, and it comes upon all his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Curſe of it, only as they are in him; <hi>in him all have ſinned, Rom.</hi> 5 2. So all the Saints are ſaid to be the ſeed of Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Covenant is made with him, and all the graces of the Covenant, and the promiſes of the Covenant are made unto him as unto the head, and unto us only as we are in him, and no otherwiſe; ſo that it is by our Union that we come under Chriſts Covenant, and thereby have a right and title unto all the promiſes of the Covenant,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. <hi>laſt.</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20.</note> and priviledges thereof, <hi>In him are all the promiſes of God yea, and Amen,</hi> and your duties and obedience are no further accepted, than as they are done in him; we have acceſs in the beloved, we are juſtified, and ſanctified in him, accepted and glorified in him; even our glory in Heaven is not properly our own, <hi>we enter into our Maſters joy.</hi>

And to allure you and ſpeak to your hearts, conſider the glories of that Covenant that was made with Chriſt, into which I deſire you to be tranſlated.

                  <p n="1">1. Conſider that Chriſt is not alone in this Covenant, it was not a Covenant made with him for himſelf, but as a common perſon, a repreſentative head, a ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> that thereby he might become an everlaſting Father to all the elect of God; but the Covenant was made with him for your ſake, and that you might come under it, as you were under the Covenant of the firſt <hi>Adam:</hi> And therefore the Lord is ſaid, to give him as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Nations, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6. and <hi>chap.</hi> 49.8.

And the thing ſignified in Baptiſm (the Soul being paſſive in a Child) hath as good ground by Gods Covenant, as by the mans profeſſion, yea better (the mans profeſſion being fallible) than he can have any other way; and it is a mans own intereſt in the Covenant, that gives him title unto all thoſe priviledges: There are indeed <hi>membra praeſumptiva</hi> of the Church of God, to whom theſe priviledges do in appearance belong; but not in truth and in reality, unleſs they are within the Covenant.</p>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:52030:92" rendition="simple:additions"/> of ſuretiſhip: now we come under <hi>Adams</hi> Covenant by nature, our union with him being natural; for we are born under it; but the Covenant of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is not ſo; and therefore we come under Chriſts Covenant freely and by conſent, for our new birth is voluntary, and our conſent is free; we are drawn and yet we come, for Gods drawing makes men willing to come; and therefore faith is commonly expreſſed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; <hi>who ever will let him come,</hi> Rev. 22. There is therefore no way of getting into Chriſts Covenant but by our conſent, <hi>by laying hold of his Covenant,</hi> Eſa. 56.4.<note place="margin">Eſay 56.4.</note> and this is that I would exhort you to; the word in the original ſignifies <hi>to take faſt hold of a thing, and that ſtrongly and with all a mans might,</hi> as in <hi>Job</hi> 2.3. it is ſaid of <hi>Job,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 2.3.</note> 
                     <hi>that he did hold faſt his integrity;</hi> Satan and his friends would have plucked it from him, and have made him to conclude againſt himſelf, that he was an Hypocrite, and his heart unſound before God, but he yet held it, and ſaid, I will not part with my integrity till I die; and ſo <hi>Job</hi> 8.15. it's ſaid of a Hypocrite, that made himſelf a houſe of gifts, and common graces,<note place="margin">Job 8.15.</note> and outward performances, and upon this houſe he leans, puts all his confidence; and when God by the way comes and ſhews him the deceit of it, and that it is but a ſandy foundation upon which it is built, the ſelf-flattery of his own ſpirit, and that it is but a Caſtle in the Air, and will do him no good, in the evil day the ſtorm will overflow his hiding place, yet the man <hi>holds it faſt,</hi> he will live and dye with them, and will not caſt away his own righteouſneſs: it is ſuch a taking hold of the Covenant that is here meant, with all a mans heart and might. But you'l ſay, <hi>What is it for a man to take hold of Chriſts Covenant?</hi> We have formerly heard, that there are two wayes of conveyance, either by way of gift, or by way of dowry. The promiſes and all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Covenant, yea the Covenant it ſelf is not beſtowed upon us, as a man would give a gift to another without any farther relation; but it is by way of a dowry, which you cannot have without the perſon: ſo it is here, Chriſt in the Covenant is a common perſon, a ſecond <hi>Adam;</hi> and if we have an intereſt in him, and be repreſented by him, the Covenant belongs unto us; but there can be no benefit in his Covenant, without intereſt in his perſon. As we ſee the ground and intendment of union is,<note place="margin">1 John 5.11.12.</note> that there may be a communion, and a communication; and all communion is grounded upon union, and is the fruit of it;<note place="margin">Gal. 3. ult.</note> it's our union with the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> that brings us under his Covenant; wherefore as ſoon as a man becomes a man, his Covenant and the curſe of it takes hold on him; and therefore Infants die: ſo it was the union of Chriſt with us that brought him under our Covenant; <hi>he was made of a woman, under the Law:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note> had he not been one with us, he could never have ſtood in our ſtead living and dying; ſo it is our being one with him, that gives us an intereſt in his Covenant, and brings us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) The terms and condition of this union is, that you ſhall receive and accept him, and give up your ſelves to him: <hi>I am my Beloveds, and my Beloved is mine:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 6.3.</note> you muſt cut off your right Hand, and pluck out your right Eye, deny your ſelves, that nothing ſhall be exalted in the heart but Chriſt; and nothing muſt be dear to a man in compariſon of Chriſt; he muſt ſell all to buy the Pearl, <hi>Matt.</hi> 13.45. and part with it with joy, not only part with a mans ſins, but his righteouſneſs, and priviledges, and take them up by a new title; as <hi>Paul, he ſuffered the loſs of all things,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 3.8, 9.</note> but found them all in Chriſt, and attained them by a far better and more glorious title. A man muſt do it as you do in Copy-holds, a man muſt bring in his old Copy into the Court, and there muſt be a ſurrender made, and then you ſhall take it up again, and have a new, and a better ſtate in it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A man muſt part with ſin as a ſnare, and with ſelf as a ſacrifice, and lay them all down at Chriſts feet, he muſt be his utmoſt end, that gives order and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to all the means tending thereunto, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) The will of man is deſperately ſhut againſt Chriſt, and againſt this way of cloſing with him, partly from a mans ungodlineſs, becauſe it is the higheſt way in which God will be honoured, and partly becauſe a man hates the terms and conditions that Chriſt muſt be received upon; a man cannot give up all unto Chriſt, ſin is ſweet and ſelf is dear, and the great God of the world, the Idol that a man has worſhipped all his life time; now for a man to come and change his God, it is that which the will of man is hardly brought unto; and therefore Chriſt puts it upon the will, John 5.40. <hi>You will not come to me: who ever will, let him come and take of the water of life freely;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 22.</note>

When the Lord brings a man into the bond of Chriſts Covenant, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an heir of Promiſe, there is an almighty power put forth upon the will to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade it, and to open the heart to accept of Chriſt, and to be ſubject unto him upon his own terms: Gen. 9.27. <hi>The Lord ſhall perſwade</hi> Japhet <hi>to dwell in the tents of</hi> Sem: which all the rhetorick of the Angels in Heaven, and Miniſters the Angels upon Earth could never do; none but the Spirit of Chriſt can open the heart, it is alone in his power that has the <hi>Keys of Hell and Death,</hi>

And thus a man looking upon Chriſt as the perſon in whom there is a Covenant and an Image laid up, and ſeeing the glory of that Covenant, and the beauty of holineſs that is in that Image, of both he deſires to be made partaker; but there is the greater excellency, becauſe the perſon goes with them; there is an excellency in the dowry, but there is more in the perſon; the ſoul thus accepting of Chriſt and catching at the terms of the Covenant, as a dying man does at any thing, looks upon it as a golden Septer held forth to him by the law condemned, and as the brazen Serpent exalted upon the Pole to a ſin-ſtung ſoul; and the heart does greedily and with all its might take hold of it, as a man would do a Cord let down as the only means to pluck him out of a dungeon, or to ſave him from drowning and periſhing.</p>

The Scripture makes Chriſt the Sun in the Firmament of all excellency; and the more any thing partakes of him, the more glorious it is; as the ſecond Temple was, and <hi>Johns</hi> miniſterie, <hi>the Law and the Prophets were till John,</hi> but afterwards the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel comes, which was a clearer diſcovery of Chriſt; and they were all eclipſed; though the Law had much more outward pomp and glory, yet becauſe it did diſcover Chriſt but darkly in compariſon of the Goſpel, therefore that is ſaid to exceed in glory; and ſo in Scripture the Saints do aſcribe glory one to another as they are in Chriſt, and according to their priority in Chriſt, as the Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.7. <hi>Who were in Chriſt before me,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in another place, <hi>I was like one that was born out of due time, becauſe laſt of all he appeared unto me,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. and therefore <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>It abated his earneſt deſire of ſome principal part of his own good works, becauſe nomen Chriſti non erat ibi, the name of Chriſt was not there:</hi> had the Lord put man fallen under the Covenant of the Angels, that fell not, it had been an honour, and put them into the ſame condition with them; but it is far beyond it to put them under the ſame Covenant that was made with him whom the Angels worſhip; and the higheſt honour that we have by Chriſt is our union with him; and our legal union ſtanding before God in the ſame Covenant with him is the higheſt part of that honour: for our natural union bearing with him the ſame Image doth flow from it. It's a great honour to ſtand before God in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, but the ground thereof is becauſe we ſtand before God under the Covenant of Chriſt; the inheritance of Chriſt is in the Saints, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. they are therefore ſaid to be the <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſt,</hi> as Chriſt is the glory of the Father; his glory ſhall be at the laſt to have a

It is taking hold of his Covenant; and therefore the Covenant of Grace is ſaid to be a <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Covenant;</hi> And what is it makes the match between any but conſent?<note place="margin">Hoſ. 2:19.</note> And therefore it's generally concluded by our Divines, amongſt the eſſentials of marriage, for parties to give mutual conſent, according unto that received rule of the Civil Law, <hi>where there is not the conſent of both parties, it ought not to be held</hi> legal Matrimony. There may be a wooing, and a raviſhment, but truly, and properly, there can be no Marriage without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. It is therefore a conſent joyntly in one and the ſame Covenant: And what makes us become the Sons of Chriſt?

                  <p n="3">3. It's a wonderful comfort to have a ſhare in the merits of Chriſt, and in the purchaſe that is made thereby: for as by the ſin of man there was a curſe incurr'd, and an inheritance forfeited; ſo in the redemption wrought by Chriſt, there muſt be the Law ſatisfied, and a new inheritance purchaſed. For there are two parts of this redemption, there is an old debt to be paid, and there is a new purchaſe to be made: Bare ſatisfaction of the old debt, and performing the obedience unto the Law as our ſurety that was due from us, is not enough; the payment of an old debt, will not make a new purchaſe; therefore in Chriſt there muſt be ſomething that muſt exactly anſwer the Law, and that will pay the debt of the Law that was due from us; and there muſt be ſomething that muſt be above the Law, which is called <hi>ſuperlegale meritum,</hi> and that will alſo purchaſe us a new inheritance. There are three things neceſſarily required to this merit to make a new purchaſe, (1) It muſt be <hi>proprium,</hi> a man muſt give of his own; and ſo no man can do: <hi>Of thine own have we given thee; for all things are of thee.</hi> (2) <hi>Indebitum,</hi> ſomething that is not due, that a man doth not owe; that which is a mans duty, he muſt ſay when he hath done it, he is an unprofitable Servant. (3) The reward muſt not be of grace but of debt, and juſtice due; but there is no ſuch thing in any thing man can do; for eternal life is the gift of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52030:95"/> God, <hi>It is by grace we are ſaved, through faith, and that not of our ſelves, it is the gift of God,</hi> Epheſ. 2.8, 9. All this meets in Chriſt, it was his <hi>own,</hi> for he thought it no robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be equal with God; and he did lay down his own life, and it was free, it was not due, for it could not have been a ſacrifice, had it not been voluntary. And it was perfect; there was infinitely more worth in him, than is in all the Souls that he hath redeemed, and all the glory that he hath purchaſed; and therefore his ſubjects do ſet a higher price upon his perſon, than they do upon his benefits, as God the Father himſelf doth. Queſtion, <hi>How ſhould a man come to get an intereſt in this merit?</hi> The Lord gives Grace and Glory, we can merit nothing. It's true as our ſurety, paying our debt by the agreement with the Father, you ſhall be free; but there is a Covenant between the Father and the Son, not only that his ſatisfaction ſhall be ours,<note place="margin">Iſa. 49.6.</note> but his purchaſe ours alſo; for the Lord hath given him, <hi>not only to raiſe up the tribes of Jacob, but alſo for ſalvation to the ends of the earth:</hi> As he hath a ſeed,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.2.</note> ſo he hath an inheritance; for he is appointed heir of all things, and in him we have an inheritance, being with him <hi>Coheirs, Rom.</hi> 8. And all is becauſe we come under his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In reſpect of the promiſes of the Covenant of Grace; for it's a Covenant that doth conſiſt in Promiſes,<note place="margin">Heb. 8.6.</note> it is a Covenant that is eſtabliſhed by Law, that is firmly grounded upon <hi>better promiſes,</hi> Heb. 8.6. Now wherein are they <hi>better promiſes,</hi> whenas to <hi>Adam</hi> God did promiſe life and ſalvation, not only here but hereafter? (1) They are better, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the promiſes of the firſt Covenant were conditional as rewards of Grace; but it did not promiſe Grace. (2) They are better, becauſe they promiſe higher things; the Lord to be your God, and Chriſt to be your head, your Husband, his Spirit to be the guide of your way, and alſo the earneſt of your inheritance; a higher Righteouſneſs, a higher Sonſhip, a nearer Union, a fuller Communion; as the Spouſe of Chriſt, and as his Members, and a more exceeding eternal weight of glory, being rewarded not according unto the Covenant of man, but according to the Covenant of Chriſt. (3) Better promiſes, becauſe of their aſſurance and ſtability; the promiſes of the firſt Covenant might come to an end and be ſwallowed up in the Curſe, as they were, but the promiſes of the ſecond are the <hi>ſure mercies of David;</hi> for the righteouſneſs of it is an everlaſting righteouſneſs, and therefore the promiſes are eternal promiſes. (4) But there is one thing as great as any of theſe, and that is, they are all of them the promiſes made unto Chriſt, and by vertue of the Covenant belong unto him, 2 Cor. 1.20. <hi>In him are all the promiſes yea, and Amen:</hi> That is, they are made unto him, and they belong unto us, and unto us are fulfilled only by vertue of our Union with him; as we live in him, and dye in him, ſo we receive promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in him; and this is the ſweetneſs of all Goſpel promiſes, they do every one of them carry a man to the fountain of his intereſt, and that brings into the Soul infinitely the more ſweetneſs. As if a Wife take a favour from her Husband, and look no further, there is not ſo much in it; but yet in every favour ſhe is carried back unto the Marriage Covenant, which aſſures her not only of this, but alſo of all others; whatever is his ſhe has a right to, becauſe of the Covenant paſt between them; this is ſweet to her: And ſo here, it brings into the Soul the ſweetneſs of all the promiſes, together with the preſent mercy. As to a wicked man in Hell, that hath the terrors of God upon him, every evil doth carry him unto the fountain of it, and that is to the anger and hatred of God, and the curſe of the Covenant that he hath broken, and this imbitters his miſery a Thouſand times more; for now the Soul ſaith, this is but a pledge of infinitely more wrath: So it is here, every promiſe carries him to the fountain, and that aſſuring him not only of this ſupply, but whatever elſe he can ſtand in need of; for in a mans intereſt in Chriſt is infinite more ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than in any bleſſing or benefit we receive by him. Now when a man ſhall look upon this promiſe not only as ſweet, but as his inheritance, as he is a Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and an Heir of Promiſe, it brings with it infinitely more ſweetneſs than the promiſes of mercy it ſelf abſtractly, and in it ſelf injoyed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For all the duties and obedience to the Covenant: And this is commonly the great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of the people of God, the Goſpel requires obedience as well as the Law, and there is a Law of Chriſt to be kept, and there is a yoak of Chriſt to be born, and Chriſt that hath aboliſhed the Law as a Covenant and a Curſe, has eſtabliſhed the Law as a rule of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel obedience, and hath therein made it a hand-maid to the Goſpel; and therefore the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was given in the hand of a Mediator.<note place="margin">Gal. 3.19.</note> And how ſhall we be able to perform this duty by the power of inherent grace? It is impoſſible, (1) from the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of ſin:<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>There is a law in the members, rebelling againſt the law of the mind;</hi> and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Law requires a holy nature, as well as a holy life. (2) From the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Grace: Says the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Not that I have already attained, not that I am alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy perfect,</hi> &amp;c. And how then ſhall a man appear before God? Now comes in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52030:95"/> of Chriſt, and of this Covenant he is a ſurety,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.22.</note> not only to pay the debt that we did owe under the old Covenant, but alſo to perform the duty that is required of me under the new; and therefore the Lord did lay help on one that is mighty; we ſhould have failed,<note place="margin">Pſal. 89.</note> for we could neither pay the debt of the one, nor do the duty of the other; therefore the Lord hath laid all upon Chriſt, and will expect all of him; and he muſt preſent us unto his Father, as a glorious Church without ſpot or wrinkle; and what imperfection ſoever there be in our duties, he muſt offer them pure before God with his odours; and all this is from the Covenant made with him: <hi>In him is our fruit found.</hi>

                  <p n="6">6. The ſtability of the Covenant can never fail, it is an everlaſting Covenant and ſure mercy; (1) Upon the faithfulneſs of God, it's confirmed with an Oath. (2) From the obedience of Chriſt who hath performed all that is required in this Covenant. (3) From the promiſe made unto him: for the Oath is made firſt to Chriſt;<note place="margin">Heb. 7.

                     </label> Doctrine, <hi>That the Covenant of grace that was principally made with Chriſt, is alſo made with the faithful, the members of Chriſt.</hi> In the opening of this <hi>Doctrine</hi> there are three things to be ſpoken to, (1) <hi>To prove that the Covenant is made with the Saints.</hi> (2) <hi>To ſhew why it muſt be ſo.</hi> (3) <hi>To ſhew the different manner how it's made with Chriſt, and with them.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Covenant of grace is made with the Saints, and they are all federates there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1 Cor. 15.47.</note> will appear by theſe arguments. 1. From the type of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> for he is made the type of him that was to come: Now the Covenant that God did make with <hi>Adam</hi> was not made with him only, but with all his poſterity; as appears plainly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the curſe of the Covenant being broken comes upon them all; in <hi>Adam</hi> all dyed becauſe in him all ſinned; now the Covenant muſt be as large as the Curſe, and the Curſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them muſt argue the Covenant to be made with them: and ſo it is in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Covenant alſo, God has not only taken Chriſt into Covenant, but he being an everlaſting Father has taken in all his ſeed; for he is the Father of all the faithful, and the Lord enters into Covenant with them alſo. So that all his poſterity were bound unto the ſame Covenant, and to perform the ſame obedience, or to endure the ſame Curſe that he did, if they did tranſgreſs. And whereas it may be ſaid then, as all that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> lay upon his poſterity, ſo all that is required of the ſecond, lies upon his poſterity alſo; and as what <hi>Adam</hi> was to perform, they were in their own perſons to perform, ſo what Chriſt did perform that alſo lies upon all his poſterity to perform: in this there is a great deal of difference between <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt; the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood before God as a publick perſon, as a repreſentative head, that is, ſuch a
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:52030:96"/> one as perſonates and acts the part of another by the allowance of the Law; ſo that what he doth is by the Law accounted to be done by him whom he repreſents, and what is done unto him is accounted by the Law to be done unto the other: ſo in the Law an Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney appears for another, receives money or takes poſſeſſion for another, and that ſtands good in Law, as if a man had done it in his own perſon; and ſo Embaſſadors do repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Princes or States from whence they come, and from whom they are ſent; what they do, the Prince that ſends them is accounted by the Law of Nations to do, if they act according to their commiſſion; and what is done unto them, the Prince doth take as done unto himſelf, &amp;c. And ſo indeed <hi>Adam</hi> was a Common or a Publick perſon ſtanding in our ſtead, that what he did was accounted to be ours, whether to righteouſneſs and life, or unto ſin and death; but yet ſo, that had he ſtood, the ſame obedience was in their own perſons required of his poſterity for themſelves as was required of <hi>Adam,</hi> though not with the ſame reſpect; not as publick perſons and repreſentative heads; ſo that if they had not performed it, they had fallen for themſelves, though all mankind had not fallen, if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood; <hi>for the woman was firſt in the tranſgreſſion,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.12.</note> and yet though the woman fell firſt, all mankind did not fall in her fall; but by <hi>one man ſin entred into the world,</hi> and therefore it was not every ſin of a particular perſon, that would have deſtroyed all mankind, but of their repreſentative only. But the ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant hath this in it, that the firſt never had in <hi>Adam,</hi> the ſecond Covenant hath a ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that is ſomething more than a publick perſon, that is one that repreſents ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſtands in his place, and is bound unto his debt; ſo that if the perſon ingaged pay not the debt, the ſurety muſt; and ſo <hi>Adam</hi> was not the ſurety for all mankind, that he would perform the debt or bear the curſe for them all; there was no Covenant that had a Surety but Chriſt, and he was a ſurety of the firſt Covenant,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note> made under the Law, and of a better Covenant to perform all the duties of the Goſpel. So that all that is required is of Chriſt as the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> only in his publick capacity and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation; the Law is required of us, but if we perform it not, we have a ſurety that has undertaken it. Thus as the firſt Covenant was made with the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> and all his poſterity, ſo the ſecond Covenant is made with the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> and all his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty alſo.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We read of a Covenant made with Perſons and people, and promiſed unto them as ſpecial mercies, a Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> a Covenant made with <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.5. <hi>The Lord has made with me an everlaſting Covenant in all things or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and ſure.</hi> And there is a Covenant made with a people alſo, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31. God made a Covenant with the houſe of <hi>Judah,</hi> a Covenant that he would bring them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the bonds of the Covenant, and <hi>Eſa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>Every one that thirſts come to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and I will make an everlaſting Covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of</hi> David, and Ezec. 16. <hi>I entred into Covenant with thee, and thou becameſt mine;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Zac. 9.12. <hi>By the blood of thy Covenant I have delivered the priſoners out of the pit, in which there is no water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Men are ſaid to make the Covenant and to break it: <hi>Hezekiah</hi> exhorts them, 2 Chron. 30.7, 8. <hi>to give the hand unto the Lord:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Chron. 30.7, 8.</note> it's an expreſſion of entring into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; as <hi>ſtriking the hand</hi> is in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> an expreſſion of entring into ſuretiſhip for another: there are four expreſſions of it in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.24. <hi>All the Princes, and the mighty men; and all the houſe of the Kingdom gave their hands unto</hi> Solomon: it notes a military ſubjection by way of Covenant and agreement between them, they did take an oath of Allegiance unto him. And ſo that expreſſion <hi>to joyn the hand,</hi> Ezeck. 17.18. <hi>He hath broken the Covenant after he had given his hand,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Job</hi> 17.3. <hi>to ſtrike hand</hi> is to enter into ſuretiſhip or to be engaged in a Covenant; ſo the ſaints are ſaid <hi>to enter into Covenant with the Lord by ſacrifice,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 50.5. Eſay 56.</note> and they are ſaid to take hold of the Covenant: again they are ſaid <hi>to break the Covenant,</hi> which could not be if the Covenant were not made with them; and <hi>not to be faithful and conſtant therein,</hi> Pſal. 25.10. Lev. 26.15.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It will appear from the promiſes of the ſecond Covenant, though it's true, that they are all yea and amen in him, yet are they properly and formally made unto us, either the firſt promiſes of grace or elſe of reward unto grace. Promiſes of grace are, <hi>He will give his Spirit, and will give repentance, he will heal our backslidings,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>we have an unction from the holy one,</hi> &amp;c. And reward of ſervice done, either in the inward diſpoſitions, <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in ſpirit, bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. or in the outward action, 1 Cor. 9.24. <hi>So run that you may obtain;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. ult.</note> 
                     <hi>your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi> And though the Covenant be made only out of free grace, yet the Saints do claim theſe promiſes, not only out of mercy, but from
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52030:97"/> the faithfulneſs of God.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.19. 1 Jo. 1.9.</note> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>God is faithful who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that you are able: he is faithful and juſt to forgive us,</hi> &amp;c. And what is the ground of this but the Covenant of God, whereby his faithfulneſs is ingaged?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Covenant of grace is a Covenant in the hand of a Mediator, and confirmed by the death of the Teſtator;<note place="margin">Heb.</note> it's not only a Covenant, but it's a Teſtament. (1) Chriſt is the Mediator; now no man is a mediator between God and himſelf, a Mediator is not a Mediator of one, it muſt be a third perſon, a <hi>dayes-man,</hi> that muſt lay hold upon both; therefore there is a Covenant made with Chriſt, and Chriſt is a Mediator for the eſtabliſhment of the Covenant with us alſo. And (2) Chriſt is the Teſtator, he died and left his Legacies of all the promiſes to the ſaints; now no man gives a Legacy to himſelf. In the Covenant made between the Father and Chriſt, Chriſt is a party and a publick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but in this Covenant between God and us, he is a Mediator and the Teſtator, by whom we receive all the Legacies and Inheritance, that he has purchaſed for us and granted to us.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 4.11.</note>6. The Sacraments are ſeals of the Covenant of grace: Now if we look upon the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with Chriſt, and conſider that his faith was perfect in God, and he knew the Lord would not fail him, but ſaies, <hi>He is near that juſtifies me, who will contend with me? he will not leave my ſoul in Hell,</hi> &amp;c. But though Chriſt had a ſtrong faith, yet we have but a weak faith, and therefore had need of Sacraments and outward ſigns to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it; wherefore the Sacraments are not to confirm the Covenant made with Chriſt, but the Covenant made with the Saints; he to whom the Covenant is made, unto him the ſeals are to be applied; and it would ſeem unreaſonable for the Covenant to be made unto one, and the ſeals to be applied unto the other; therefore there is a Covenant made with the ſaints, and to this Covenant the Sacraments are added as ſeals.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. There is a double oath to confirm this Covenant, there is an oath made by God the Father to Chriſt, and there is an oath alſo made to us; there is an oath made unto Chriſt, and therefore he is ſaid to be made a Prieſt by a Covenant oath, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.4. and the oath to us, Heb. 6.17, 18. <hi>Who are heirs of promiſe, that by two immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lie,</hi> &amp;c. God having taken up unchangeable counſels concerning this Covenant, he did therefore to ſhew the Immutability of his Counſel confirm it by an oath, and being ſo engaged, he cannot go back, though that be true alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is faithful and cannot deny himſelf. Yet becauſe his counſel was unchangeable, and he did never intend to alter his Covenant for ever, therefore he did ſwear, that he might ſhew how much his heart was in it, and that he did never intend to change it, but his counſel in it was unchangeable.</p>
                  <p>And this Doctrine I do the rather pitch upon in oppoſition to the licentious tenent of the Antinomians from the former Doctrine; The Covenant of grace is made with Chriſt, and he has undertaken to perform all duties required of us, and bear all the curſe for us as he was our ſurety; therefore ſay they, <hi>all is required of Chriſt, and nothing of us;</hi> and ſo though we walk never ſo looſly and corruptly, yet God will require all at his hands; and while Chriſt doth not fail, the Covenant on our part can never be broken. Indeed this is a truth, <hi>that God has laid help upon one that is mighty;</hi> and he does expect all at Chriſts hand, becauſe he can never fail, the Covenant cannot be broken, for he is the ſurety thereof: but yet we muſt remember withall, that we come under the ſame Covenant with Chriſt, and we in our place are bound unto the ſame obedience, and ſo far as we come ſhort, we ſin, and may be charged with unfaithfulneſs before God; though this ſhall never break the Covenant, nor be imputed unto a man to his deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, becauſe this Covenant has a ſurety; yet as the Covenant with the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> bound all his poſterity unto the ſame duty, ſo does the Covenant made with the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> alſo; only a man might have broken the firſt Covenant for himſelf, though he could not break it for all mankind; but under the ſecond Covenant a man cannot break the Covenant for himſelf, (ſo as not to be capable of mercy upon repentance) becauſe the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is the ſurety thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Reaſons why it was neceſſary that the Covenant of Grace ſhould be made with all the faithful, and not with Chriſt only as their head, are</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> 1. To anſwer thoſe great ends, why God will deal with man in a Covenant way. (1) The Lord will enter into Covenant that he may declare his glory, not only in a way of goodneſs, but in a way of faithfulneſs. In the Creation, the Lord did ſhew forth much power and wiſdom; and in the Law much holineſs: But there was no way to manifeſt his faithfulneſs,<note place="margin">Mic. 7.20.</note> but by Covenant. <hi>The Lord hath choſen you above all people, that you might know that he is the Lord the faithful God.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8, 9. there is the <hi>truth</hi> of God to the <hi>Jews</hi> herein manifeſted, and the <hi>mercy</hi> of God to the Gentiles, who were ſtrangers,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52030:97"/> and not before taken into Covenant; ſo that it is hereby the Lord doth gloriouſly manifeſt an Attribute, and that which ſhall manifeſt an Attribute muſt be no ſmall matter; and therefore when the Lord doth ſhew his power, he doth create the Heavens and the Earth, and lays the beams of his Chambers in the waters, raiſeth ſuch a roof as the Heavens, and lays ſuch a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation as the earth, and ſettles it upon nothing; if he will ſhew his love, he will give his Son; and if his grace, he will pardon ſin; and if his holineſs, he will give a Law, if his mercy to the veſſels of mercy, give them Heaven, a kingdom of joy and glory; and if his wrath, he will make Hell. So that whatever the Lord hath done in the world, is for the manifeſtation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and that which ſhall make manifeſt any Attribute of God to the World, muſt needs be ſome great thing. It is only this entering into Covenant, that hath manifeſted the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God, he had not been elſe known to be a faithful God unto the World, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.6. ſays the Lord, <hi>By the name Jehovah I was not known to them;</hi> that is, as a God fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the promiſes: So by the name of a <hi>God faithful and true,</hi> he had not been known, but in reference to the Covenant; and the faithfulneſs of God was ſo much the more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted by this. Had the Lord only entered into Covenant with Chriſt, he keeping the Covenant, and yielding obedience to it, the faithfulneſs of God had not been put to that ſtreſs and trial as it hath been, now that the Covenant is made with man, and he unſteady therein, and does tranſgreſs it, and forget the Covenant of his God, and yet that the Lord ſhould towards him remember his holy Covenant ſtill, and our unfaithfulneſs not make the faithfulneſs of God of none effect; and the people of God therefore notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their unfaithfulneſs, to caſt themſelves upon the Covenant of God and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes thereof (as <hi>David</hi> did) 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. and his words yet to be found, as it were <hi>tryed words,</hi> Pſal. 12.6. <hi>The words of the Lord are pure words, tryed as ſilver ſeven times,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 12.6.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The fire that tries theſe words was that of affliction, and when a man is brought into a ſtreight, and then caſts himſelf upon a promiſe, and thereby has experience of the truth and faithfulneſs of God therein, then it is ſaid to be tryed; and all the people of God have had experience of it ſo often, that there is no droſs to be found in it, no more than can be conceived to be in <hi>gold and ſilver purified ſeven times.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Lords intention was to honour man alſo; and it's one of the greateſt and higheſt dignities that the Lord hath put upon his people,<note place="margin">Jer. 13.11.</note> 
                     <hi>to bind them unto himſelf for a name and a glory;</hi> and <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.18, 19. the Lord did avouch them to be his people, to make them high above all people; and therefore the <hi>ſtaff of beauty</hi> mentioned in <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.10. is the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant between God and his people; <hi>I brake my ſtaff of beauty,</hi> that I might break my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which I made with all the people, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it is a Covenant of friendſhip, a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of marriage; and in all this there is an honour, and a kind of equality, and it's the ground of all the honour that the Lord doth put upon us; <hi>for our union with Chriſt is grounded upon our Covenant with God.</hi> Had the Lord taken Chriſt into Covenant with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf only, he had indeed honoured his Son, but not his Saints; but now to make them one with the Son, and to enter into the ſame Covenant with them, and in their own perſons, that he hath eſtabliſhed with the Son, it doth highly honour the Saints, and exalt the grace of God towards them alſo.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the Lord might bind men unto him more firmly in a way of obedience, and that the obedience might be made the more ſweet. Man was bound unto God by a <hi>bond of creation;</hi> and from whom he had his being, unto him he did owe his ſervice; but the Lord will bind him unto him with a further cord and <hi>bond of ſtipulation;</hi> the one was natural and neceſſary, and the other voluntary; and though he did owe obedience, had there been never a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made him of a reward, yet much more when the Lord will bind himſelf by Covenant, to reward his meaneſt ſervices. The ground of the Covenant is love,<note place="margin">Deut. 7.7, 8. 2 Cor. 5.19. Jer. 31.3. Hoſ. 2.19.</note> and God loves the Saints alſo in his Son, and is willing to be reconciled to them in him; and a man may ſay, the yoak of Chriſt is not only eaſie, but profitable alſo, <hi>Matt.</hi> 11.29. becauſe it hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe annexed to every ſervice; and for this cauſe was the Covenant made with the Saints, that they might be a willing people in all their obedience, there being a promiſe going with the duty in whatever was required of them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the people of God might exerciſe faith in their prayers, putting theſe bonds in ſuit that the Lord hath made over unto them, when they look upon themſelves as ſons of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Heirs of Promiſe, and Children of the Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thereby they come with a great deal the more boldneſs before the throne of grace, as <hi>David,</hi> 1 Chron. 17.23, 24. <hi>Let the thing thou haſt ſpoken concerning thy ſervant and his houſe, be eſtabliſhed for ever;</hi> do as thou haſt ſaid, that thy name may be magnified for ever; the Lord of Hoſts is the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even a God to <hi>Iſrael: For becauſe thou haſt told thy ſervant, that thou wilt build him an houſe, therefore hath thy ſervant found in his heart to pray before thee; now Lord thou art God, and haſt promiſed this goodneſs to thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;

There is a Covenant made with the Saints alſo, that they may ſee that they are as ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound to obedience in their own perſons, under the ſecond Covenant, as they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the firſt Covenant; and that the doctrine of the Goſpel, though it be a Doctrine of liberty, yet is not a Doctrine of licentiouſneſs; there is as much of duty required of us now, as there was then; and ſo far as we come ſhort of the Law we ſin, and every ſuch tranſgreſſion is, ſo far as it prevails, a Covenant-breaking on our part, and an act of unfaithfulneſs; but the Covenant cannot be broken, becauſe we have a ſurety which the firſt Covenant had not; and the righteouſneſs of this Covenant ſin can never ſpend, it is an everlaſting righteouſneſs; therefore that Doctrine that ſaith God requires all of Chriſt and nothing of you, is a Doctrine of ſinful liberty; it's true, That he takes ſatisfaction in his Son, and he makes you accepted in his beloved, and therefore he will never ſuffer his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to fail; for Pſal. 102.28. <hi>Thou art the ſame, and the children of thy ſervants ſhall continue, &amp;c.</hi> yet in point of duty, he expects from us uprightneſs, and perfect obedience; ſo that it is your ſin and unfaithfulneſs, if you perform it not; as it was required of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo of all his poſterity; and as of Chriſt, ſo of all his poſterity alſo.</p>

(2) It is made with Chriſt immediately and for his own ſake, there was no mediator between God and Chriſt,<note place="margin">2 Sam 7. Dan. 21.9.</note> but the Lord accepted of his ingagement and relyed upon his faithfulneſs in performing his duty, as Chriſt did upon Gods faithfulneſs in fulfilling his promiſe; and whatever the Lord performs unto us, it is for Chriſts ſake; but it is with us mediately in him, he being the mediator of the Covenant, and of all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies thereof. (3) The promiſe made unto Chriſt, was made from everlaſting before the foundation of the world;<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.9. Rev. 13.8.</note> it's ſaid, <hi>The Lamb had a book of life before the foundation of the world;</hi> it cannot be underſtood of election, for he himſelf as mediator was elected; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſpoken in reference to this Covenant, that God did make with Chriſt before the world was,<note place="margin">Prov. 8.22.</note> he being from the beginning, and this Covenant was to take place immediately after the fall; but the Covenant with his people is made with them, when they believe and are ingrafted into Chriſt, faith being nothing elſe but a conſent unto the Covenant, and the terms of it on our part, and therefore that is an act done by the creature in time, when a man is converted; and therefore notwithſtanding the Covenant made with Chriſt, yet the elect themſelves,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.12.</note> till they be converted, are ſaid <hi>to be ſtrangers to the Covenant of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe;</hi> as it is in juſtification, though there be a juſtification <hi>in capite</hi> when Chriſt roſe from the dead, (becauſe he roſe as a publick perſon) yet there is not a perſonal juſtification in a man, till he do believe, and be made one with Chriſt, and hath thereby an intereſt in his righteouſneſs. (4) All the promiſes of the ſecond Covenant belong unto Chriſt as his purchaſe, and unto us of promiſe; to him of debt, and unto us of grace: the making of the Covenant indeed was an act of free grace with Chriſt, but the performance, and all the benefits thereof is an act of purchaſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.14. it is all the inheritance of Chriſt purchaſed by his merits, but to us it comes of grace, and meerly for Chriſts ſake. (5) Chriſt as to his Covenant hath no ſurety, God took his word, and his faithfulneſs he did rely upon, and therefore calls him <hi>faithful and true,</hi> and ſaid he had laid help on one that is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. but we have a ſurety of our Covenant to pay the debt and perform the duty:</p>

Now if a man would enter into Covenant with God, what is required of him? O that the Lord would bring his word at this time upon any ſoul, and that I might be but inſtrumental therein, to bring you under this Covenant, that your hearts may take hold of it.

                  <p>But for the preſent I would pitch upon theſe; 1. If you come not under this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, you have no intereſt in God; for the former Covenant being broken, God is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come your enemy, and he is now no more your God than he is the Devils God, and the damned Spirits God, unleſs you enter into Covenant with him anew, for there is no way for you to have an intereſt in God, but by Covenant with him:<note place="margin">Pſal. 144.</note> they are a happy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whoſe God is <hi>Jehovah;</hi> and they on the contrary are a miſerable people that have not the Lord for their God, but for their enemy. Now as the Lord came to be Chriſts God, ſo he muſt be your God; and Chriſt takes a new Covenant-right unto God to this every end; he hath a double right unto all things, [1] As he is <hi>haeres natus,</hi> as it was his natural inheritance, as he had a right to whatever his Father had; <hi>for he thinks it no robbery to be equal with him;</hi> and yet he takes a new Covenant-right unto all things; [2] As he is <hi>Haeres conſtitutus, an Heir appointed by God,</hi> that he might be able to communicate the ſame unto us; ſo he takes a new covenant-right unto God, that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the ſame Covenant the Lord might become our God, as he is Chriſts God: and how is God made over unto a man in this Covenant? It is in his all-ſufficiency,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.1.</note> ſo that look whatever ſufficiency there is in God, all this is thine, and thou mayeſt claim an intereſt in it. Now if a man had all things elſe in the world, this very conſideration would imbitter all to him, that he has no intereſt in God: as on the contrary, if a man were deprived of all things elſe, this would ſweeten all, that God is his God; as it was ſaid of <hi>Job, he loſt all that God had given him, but he had him who gave him all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaies, <hi>all meat is unſavoury that has not this ſalt:</hi> And ſo on the contrary, thou haſt all theſe good things, but thou haſt no intereſt in him who is the God of them all, and whoſe Love is infinitely in ſweetneſs beyond them all; for his <hi>loving kindneſs is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than life,</hi> and all the revenews of life: which appears, becauſe perfection of Happineſs
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52030:99"/> in Heaven lies in God alone, when a man ſhall be taken off from all the comforts of the creatures: and though while men taſte the ſweetneſs of the creatures and the pleaſures of them, they ſeem not to find that want of God, but can be content to be without him to all eternity; yet there will come a time when men ſhall know what it is to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the world, as all they do that have no intereſt in the Covenant of grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is only in the Covenant of grace that all the perſons have undertaken peculiar of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for the good of men, and no men have benefit by them but they that are brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Covenant; it is for their ſake that the Father has given the Kingdom into the hand of his Son, and what benefit other men have by it, it is but as the beaſts have, and in ſome reſpect as the Devils have; they have ſome leſs degree of torment, and that's granted them for their ſakes who are heirs of promiſe, and for their ſake the ſpirit is the <hi>prorex,</hi> and has undertaken to rule under Chriſt: all the Offices of Chriſt are for their ſake, and for their good, and all the Offices of the Spirit either inlightning, convincing, ſanctifying, or comforting, they are all for their good; and the common works of the Spirit that do fall upon any wicked men in the world is by the Saints Covenant, or elſe you ſhould have no more of them (oh hear all you wicked ones) than the Devils and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Hell have at this day. Now the great plot of the Goſpel in the new Covenant is not only to honour the Attributes of the nature, but alſo to honour the Perſons in the hearts of men; this was the way, for the Perſons to undertake certain appropriated works in the dayes of the Goſpel in the adminiſtration of the Covenant and all the parts thereof. Now as you will have no benefit by the attributes of the divine nature, but they all make againſt you, and will at laſt day bring in their ſeveral charges againſt your ſouls that are out of this Covenant, not only the Holineſs and Juſtice of God, but even the Mercy and Patience of God will cry againſt you, <hi>Juſtice Lord, for Mercies ſake;</hi> ſo you will have no benefit by the Offices of the perſons, but they will all of them be uſed againſt you, and bring in their ſeveral charges againſt you. Chriſt as a King, a Prophet and a Prieſt, will charge thee: <hi>then ſhall the King ſay, Go ye curſed:</hi> and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God as a Spirit, that has been convincing thee and inlightning thee in thy life time, ſhall condemn thee; and Chriſt as a Judge will condemn thee, and the Spirit of Chriſt as a Spirit of Bondage will in Hell perfectly torment thee: for as in Heaven the Spirit ſhall be perfectly a Spirit of Adoption, ſo he ſhall be in Hell perfectly a Spirit of Bondage for ever.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Unleſs thou art in Covenant this way, the Lord regards thee not, nor any thing that thou doſt; an inſtance of it we have, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.9. There are Gods own people, whom he took into Covenant with himſelf, and for the outward part of the Covenant they did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Covenant with him, but yet their hearts did not conſent unto the terms of the Covenant; and therefore they brake the Covenant. The meaning is not, that ever they were truly and indeed ſpiritually in Covenant; for then the Covenant could never have been broken; but they were only in the Covenant externally, but their hearts did not come up unto the ſpiritual part of the Covenant; and therefore the Lord ſaies, I regard them not, I took no care for them, I made no account of them at all, whatever became of them it was all one to me, as it is with us of things that we have no regard of; and for God not to regard a man or a people is the ſum of all Judgement: whatever did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall them, the Lord pitied them not, aſſiſted them not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in the place whence it is taken, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. there is ſomething more in it, it is, <hi>I Lorded it over them,</hi> when I conſider how the name <hi>Baal</hi> is uſed, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.16. he did exerciſe his Lordly authority over them: when they would not be ruled by him as a Husband, he doth then lay Judgement and Chaſtiſement upon them as a Lord, he did not regard their perſons; whereas preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the ſight of the Lord is the death of the Saints, yea he puts their Tears in his Bottle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he does pour out their blood as duſt, and their fleſh as dung, and he regards them not;<note place="margin">Pſal. 49.</note> 
                     <hi>but man though in honour, if he underſtands not, becomes like the beaſts that periſh.</hi> Without that Covenant he may be compared to the Beaſts that periſh, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the expreſſion, but it's ſuitable unto the intention of the Holy Ghoſt, he is unto God counted no better than a Dog that dyes in a ditch. And as it is for their perſons, ſo it is for their ſervices alſo, a man that is out of Covenant the Lord accepts no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that he doth; unto <hi>Cain</hi> and his offering he had no reſpect. But a man in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, the words of his mouth, the meditations of his heart, find acceptance with God, and be to him incenſe of a ſweet ſavour; their perſons and their ſervices, <hi>their ſmell is as the Wine of</hi> Lebanon,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.</note> according to the promiſe of acceptation; but all the ſervices of men out of the Covenant are abominable to God, as the Grapes of <hi>Sodom:</hi> all the acts performed by them that are in Covenant are as the Grapes of <hi>Lebanon;</hi> your works are very acceptable, <hi>The Sun of righteouſneſs ſhall riſe upon you with healing

(2) That in 2 Chron. 30.8. <hi>Give the hand to the Lord,</hi> which is a token and an expreſſion of a mans free and full conſent to it, when he does underſtand it, there is a mighty power inlightning the underſtanding, and bringing about and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the will to conſent to it. (3) Joſhua 24.23. <hi>Incline your hearts unto the Lord,</hi> or take up a full reſolution or purpoſe of heart to cleave to the Lord to keep this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,<note place="margin">Act 11.23.</note> and to ſtick to the terms of it, to perform all thy duties towards God by it, and expect all from God according to it, and this is properly to enter into Covenant with the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You are to hear the words of it, and to know aright the terms of it; for he that enters into Covenant with the Lord, it muſt be by giving up himſelf unto God, which muſt be a <hi>reaſonable ſervice,</hi> Rom. 12.1, 2. and therefore Chriſt, when men enter upon Religion, would have them ſit down firſt and count the coſt; for if men enter not upon any duty with a right underſtanding, their hearts will again draw back, and they will forſake it; ſo here, if men underſtand not the terms of the Covenant aright, they will depart from the living God, the conſent of the Covenant muſt be a conſent without er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, or elſe it is ſuppoſed, that if a man had known it before, he would not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; it's ſaid of a marriage Covenant, <hi>Error circa ea quae ſunt de eſſentia contractus, vitiat contractum,</hi> &amp;c. and a conſent with error, and when a man underſtands not what he doth, is no conſent. Now what are the Terms of this Covenant? They are theſe, 1. That you <hi>take Chriſt and cloſe with him in a work of faith,</hi> believe in him and be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him alone: for Gal. 3. ult. <hi>We that believe are</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed;</hi> and it is by our fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the ſteps of his faith that he becomes the Father of us all; therefore the Goſpel is ſaid to be <hi>making a marriage for his Son;</hi>

Though in all the terms of it it is ſufficiently known, and the Lord doth call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them from day to day; yet they are terms they like not, they conſent not unto them; therefore the Covenant is not made up between God and them, the whole Soul doth not conſent to accept of the Covenant upon the terms that God requires, they like them not, they are not willing to give the hand to the Lord, as it's called, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.7, 8. and it's alſo called being willing or conſenting, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.19. <hi>If you be willing and obedient, you ſhall eat the good of the Land:</hi> Till the will doth open, the ſoul of man is for ever ſhut againſt the Covenant, and it is the Lord only hath the key thereof to open the heart, as the Lord did open the heart of <hi>Lydia;</hi> elſe the Lord will ſay, I would have gathered you, but you would not. It's a Marriage Covenant, a conſent of parties is eſſential to Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and where that is wanting, the Marriage is null and void; but this conſent to the Covenant muſt be free: In what is the Will ſo free, as in acts of Election? All the World cannot force the will to chuſe any thing. When men are brought into Religion by education, and have as it were a force upon them to own ſuch and ſuch principles, and forbear ſuch and ſuch practices, it's like a force upon a man by his friends to take a Wife, that ſutes the Parents advantage, but not the Childs inclination, his heart afterwards diſlikes and falls off: ſo when the terrors of death, the fear of Hell work any affection to the ways of God, this Covenant, he will promiſe any thing, and will needs enter into Covenant with God; but it is with a mixed will, his ſoul is not free. As a Mariner in a ſtorm, he will cry, Oh! caſt out the wares to ſave the Ship and his life, but it is not a free conſent, his heart ſtill hankers after his goods; ſo ſays the Soul in reference to Chriſt, If I were left to my own liberty, I would pitch here, and make the match up between Chriſt and me, the ſight of his excellencies hath ſo taken my heart: <hi>he is the chiefeſt of ten thouſand,</hi> I grant, and <hi>fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> than <hi>the daughters of men;</hi> but there is, alas! a preingagement between me and my earthly treaſure, my Parents have already provided for me, <hi>I have goods for</hi> many years, it's hard to undergo loſſes, and croſſes, and reproaches for Chriſts Name and the Goſpel, and here the ſoul ſticks and the match is never made up.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But a Soul that is truly in love with Chriſt, and has his Image fixed deeply upon his heart, his conſent to the terms that Chriſt propoſes, when he enters into Covenant, is univerſal, he takes Chriſt for righteouſneſs, and gives up himſelf unto him. But there is many a ſoul, that though they do conſent to many of the terms that Chriſt propoſes, and would take Chriſt for their righteouſneſs, yet they are not willing to deny themſelves, or if they do come ſo far, yet their ſelf-denial is not univerſal, it is not utterly, there is ſome ſin he cannot forſake; or if he bear Chriſts yoak, yet he would not willingly bear his Croſs. But there muſt be (1) a general conſent unto the Covenant in all the terms of it, elſe there is a treaty only, but no agreement. (2) And in the next place, this conſent muſt be perpetual and in all times, and conditions, for the Covenant is an everlaſting Covenant, and therefore the conſent to it muſt be for everlaſting, never to look for more or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, beloved, for ever: In Matrimony there is a certain kind of perpetual obligation to ſervice, the Soul muſt never draw back: For then ſurely the Lord will take no pleaſure in thee. It is a Harlot that is for luſt, and for hire, and only loves a perſon in his proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but a true wife loves at all times, as a friend doth, who is ſtill as thy own Soul. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all you that have been inlightned with a beam of light and love, to ſee the excellencies that are in Chriſt, let your Soul be ſtill raviſhed with his Laws, for they are better than Wine: conſent ſtill to the terms that he propoſes to you, and let neither croſſes in your way fright you on the one hand, nor carnal comforts allure you on the other, to draw you back from your beloved, for he is the chiefeſt of Ten thouſand, and his ways are holy, juſt and good.</p>

Unto all this there muſt be added a full reſolution and purpoſe of heart, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all the duties that are required of us in this Covenant, and to keep cloſe unto the terms of it. <hi>Joſhua</hi> made a Covenant for the people, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.23, 24. and in that day they ſay, <hi>The Lord thy God will we ſerve, and his voice will we obey;</hi> and thus alſo in <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.5. they bind themſelves in a perpetual Covenant never to be forgotten, to cleave to the Lord with full purpoſe of heart; and therefore they are willing to engage themſelves in all Gods ways, to ſhew the ſincerity of their heart and purpoſe, they will ſubſcribe it,<note place="margin">Neh. 10.6.</note> they do bind themſelves with a curſe, and this is the anſwer of a good Conſcience, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. when a man doth ingage no more than the purpoſe of his heart is to perform;<note place="margin">Jer. 32.40.</note> Gods Covenant with us is a <hi>Covenant of ſalt,</hi> that is perpetual, <hi>Sal du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raturae amicitiae ſymbolum.</hi> So <hi>Pierius.</hi> God is always mindful of his Covenant, and ſo ſhould we be of ours alſo,<note place="margin">Jer. 11.5.</note> as the Lord ſays, <hi>Obey my voice according to all that I command thee, ſo ſhall you be my people, and I will be your God, and I will perform the oath that I

And thus we ſhould take heed of keeping the Covenant, or elſe, though the Lord continue faithful in reference to the promiſes of eternity, becauſe Chriſt is the ſurety, yet in regard of temporal promiſes, you may go without them, and many of them never be performed unto you.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, may a man that is in the Covenant of Grace break the Covenant? may the Covenant of Grace be broken as the Covenant of Works was? If it may not be broken, to what end do you exhort us to keep it? It's true, that the Covenant of Grace cannot be broken, a man that is once in Covenant is ever in Covenant, and the grounds of it are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Love of God that made the Covenant is an everlaſting Love, and therefore the Covenant it ſelf is every where called an everlaſting Covenant; and the Lord ſaith; If you can bring another flood upon the Earth, and if you can ſtop the Sun in his courſe, and change the Ordinances of Heaven, then the Covenant might be broken, that he had made with his people. Therefore <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. the Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>that nothing ſhall ſeparate us from the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord;</hi> for the Lord loves us with an everlaſting Love.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a Covenant made with the perſons of men; mens perſons are firſt taken into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and there is this difference between the Covenant of Grace and the Covenant of Works; in the later Covenant the works were taken into Covenant firſt, and then the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the works ſake, and ſo long as their works continued holy, ſo long their perſons were to be accepted and find favour, and honour with the Lord, Gen. 4.7. <hi>If thou doeſt well,</hi> there is an elevation and a lifting up of the face, but if thou doſt evil curſed is thy perſon for thy works ſake; and there is an <hi>ira redundans in perſonam, wrath falling on the perſon,</hi> that doth immediately follow thereupon: but now in the Covenant of Grace it is quite contrary, mens perſons are firſt taken into Covenant and accepted, and then their works for their perſons ſake; <hi>the Lord had reſpect unto</hi> Abel <hi>and unto his offering;</hi> and therefore till the perſon be in Covenant the works are abominable before God. Now the works of the Saints may not always be accepted of God, he may be and is often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with the acts of his covenant-people; but yet their perſons alwayes find acceptance with him, their perſons are the ſame, <hi>I will viſit their offences with a rod, and their ſins with ſcourges; but my loving kindneſs I will not take from their perſons, my Covenant I will not break,</hi> Pſal. 89. there is an <hi>ira ſimplex, ſimple anger</hi> that doth reach to the ſin, but not to the perſon, he is never a child of wrath more after his perſon is taken into a ſtate of adoption with the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Their union with Chriſt is that which puts them into the ſecond Covenant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. as this union gives them intereſt in Chriſts righteouſneſs and Sonſhip, ſo it doth firſt ſtate them in the Covenant, which is the ground of all the reſt; the intendment of God was, that the union between Chriſt and them ſhould be the means to convey all this to their
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:52030:103" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſouls; all comes in by Union: Now, ſo long as the Union between Chriſt and a ſoul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, ſo long the Covenant cannot be broken; but this Union is indiſſoluble; ſin can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, nay death cannot ſeparate between God and a ſoul in Covenant with him; and therefore as they live, ſo they dye in the Lord, and ſleep in Jeſus.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The righteouſneſs of this Covenant, is an everlaſting righteouſneſs. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. <hi>The Lord hath finiſhed tranſgreſſion, and made an end of ſin,</hi> in the great condemning power of it, and <hi>brought in everlaſting righteouſneſs,</hi> ſuch as ſin could never ſpend, for he is the ſon of righteouſneſs, the Lord of righteouſneſs, and therefore his Covenant can never be broken, ſeeing the righteouſneſs of the Covenant can never be expended.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Chriſt is the ſurety of this better Covenant, and therefore though we pay not the debt that we owe, he hath undertaken it, and the Lord will expect all of him, and thence he is ſaid to lay help on one that is mighty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. he will take your words no more, but Chriſt is able to pay it; as he did the debt of the firſt Covenant, ſo he is able to perform the duty of the ſecond; the Lord hath ingaged him in it, and he expects all from him, as from the ſurety of the Covenant which he hath undertaken.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Laſtly, This Covenant can never be broken, becauſe there is an everlaſting principle of Grace begun in the Soul that doth always lay hold of the Covenant, and cleave to it, and conſent to it, and work towards it; for it is incorruptible and immortal ſeed, and therefore, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>This is the Covenant I will make with you, I will write my law in your heart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that you ſhall never depart from me.</hi> In a Married condition there may be many failings in a Wife, or a Husband, as neglect, diſobedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the Marriage Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is never broken, till ſhe take another Husband; and the Covenant of Grace is a Marriage Covenant: Now though there be many errors and failings in a Wife, yet unleſs thou chuſe another Husband, and ſubject thy ſelf to another Lord, the Covenant between God and thee is not broken. It is a matter of wonderful conſolation, that the Covenant between us and the Lord is a <hi>Covenant of ſalt,</hi> that the ſins of the people of God, though they be many, yet they cannot break the Covenant; How ſhould the conſideration of this rich Grace and Mercy, make the Saints triumph over Death and Hell! <hi>O death where is thy ſting, O Grave where is thy victory? bleſſed be God we are more than Conquerors, through Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet you had need be exhorted, not to break this Covenant; 1. By reaſon of the falſeneſs of our own hearts;<note place="margin">Jer. 2.24.</note> for we are like a <hi>wild Aſſe in the wilderneſs, that doth traverſe her paths,</hi> that no hedges or fetters can hold her; in ſo much, that the Lord ſpeaks it with admiration, <hi>How weak is thy heart!</hi> Ezek. 16.30. That it's not able to hold out againſt any temptation, not able to bear any one affliction, but immediately it's ready to depart from God;<note place="margin">Gen. 49.4.</note> 
                     <hi>unſtable as water;</hi> there is a treachery and a perfidiouſneſs of ſpirit in the beſt of us, and therefore we had need be often called upon; <hi>Let him that thinks he ſtands, take heed leſt he fall; and let us take heed leſt any of us fall ſhort of the grace of God, and leſt there be in any of us an evil heart of unbelief, to depart from the living God, Heb.</hi> 3.12. For there is nothing that the heart of man is more prone to than backſliding; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had need be often admoniſhed to keep firm to the Covenant under which we ſtand; for there is not the greateſt cheat in the World, that is in falſeneſs and unſtedfaſtneſs like our hearts; wherefore we need many bonds upon it, and ſhould have regard to the cords of love, that God ties us with to himſelf in this Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We had need be exhorted to it, from the ſlothfulneſs and heedleſneſs of our ſpirits in whatever is good, though we be bound unto it by ſo many bonds; the Lord hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways reſpect unto his Covenant, and we deſire he ſhould do ſo; now we had need to have reſpect always to the Covenant, and to be continually minded, that we forget not what the Lord our God requires of us, as 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.31. it was a brand upon <hi>Jehu, That he took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord his God.</hi> Heedleſneſs in a mans carriage to God, is a high provocation, to walk with God at an adventure, without reſpect unto the Covenants and great ingagements in which you ſtand to God,<note place="margin">Lev. 26.23. Hoſ. 7.8.</note> this is to be towards the Lord, <hi>as a Cake not turned,</hi> which is baked only on one ſide and no more; therefore we had need have the more frequent admonition, to <hi>take heed leſt any man fall ſhort of the grace of God: we ought to give the more diligent heed, leſt by any means we let ſlip the things that we have heard;</hi> and had need to be warned, <hi>to cleave to the Lord with full purpoſe of heart,</hi> and to deſire of the Lord, <hi>that he would fix and unite our hearts to fear his name,</hi> as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> doth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.11. Let theſe things quicken any ſecure Soul that goes on in any way of diſobedience unto God; for thou wilt pay dear at laſt for all thy wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings from the paths of this Covenant, and thou ſhalt experience it, an evil and a bitter thing to draw back from God.</p>

That you may be quickened to ſeek unto the Lord for Grace to keep this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and may acknowledge before the Lord, that the ſtability and eternity of the ſecond Covenant lies not in us, nor in the obſervation of it; for, as much as in us lies, we do break it continually; but from the eternal love of God, and the inſeparable union between Chriſt and us, and the Lord having made him the ſurety of the Covenant, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſtands; but were we left unto our ſelves, we ſhould break it every day; and every ſin in us; would ſpend all the grace of the Covenant, as it did in <hi>Adam;</hi> but there is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us a fountain for a ſupply; for truly the ſtability of the Covenant doth not proceed from our part in the Covenant, as the Lord ſays in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 16.61.</note> that the mercies he would give them, ſhould not be <hi>by their Covenant,</hi> but all proceed from his; and therefore, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.12. it is, <hi>ſow in righteouſneſs, and reap in mercy;</hi> and it is <gap reason="foreign">

As one came unto a Prince, and deſired him to perform a Covenant and ingagement that he had made unto them, which he refuſing, being in his Robes, the Soldier touching his Purple ſaid, <hi>Imperator, hac veſte indutum mentiri nefas eſt, O Emperor, it is not lawful for him who his clothed with this Robe to lye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. We had need be continually minded of the Covenant, that we may fear thoſe ſins that do come neareſt a Covenant-breaking. It is true, there is no ſin of a Godly man that can break his Covenant (as I have already ſhewed you) but yet there are ſome ſins that come nearer to Covenant-breaking than others do; and in this reſpect, are to be looked upon as ſins of a very hanious nature, and of a deeper dye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is a rule, That which doth manifeſt the moſt unſoundneſs of heart, that doth break the Covenant; for the condition of the Covenant is, that a mans heart ſhould be perfect with God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.2. And it is one of theſe ſorts, or I may ſay, both theſe ſorts of ſinning that do come neareſt thereunto, (1) when a man doth ſin againſt light, and doth it deliberately, and with a high hand; for <hi>Eo magis peccatum quo magis voluntarium: The will is the meaſure of all ſins.</hi> The more of the Will there is in any evil, the greater the ſin is; and therefore it is made the meaſure of the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.26.</note> it is ſinning wilfully after a man hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the knowledge of the truth; and in this, <hi>David</hi> came neareſt to breaking this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15.5. <hi>He did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not aſide from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, ſave only in the matter of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah. David</hi> had many other ſins lay upon him; and he ſays, <hi>his iniquities were gone over his head, and as a ſore burden for him to bear,</hi> but the Lord ſaid, <hi>he turned not aſide from the Lord in any thing but this;</hi> becauſe it was a ſtudied, plotted ſin, committed againſt knowledge; and therefore with a high hand thus to ſin, did manifeſt the greateſt unfaithfulneſs of <hi>Davids</hi> ſpirit towards God, that he did ſhow all the days of his life. (2) When a man walks on in a ſin, and lies in it a long time together unrepented of, and can act it again and again, and it is as a thread drawn through the courſe of a mans life, it comes neareſt to an <hi>unſound heart,</hi> and that denominates a man an Adulterer, or an Adultereſs, as <hi>James</hi> 4.4. as we ſee in <hi>Solomon,</hi> he lived a great while in theſe evils, and though he were beloved of the Lord, yet his heart was turn'd away from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord, and he ſaid to his heart, <hi>Go to now, and I will provoke thee with wine:</hi> Now his lying and living in ſin, it is true, did not break the Covenant between God and him, yet it was the moſt dangerous ſtep to an unſound heart; and therefore came neareſt to breaking the Covenant. A godly man cannot lye, and live, and dye in any known ſin, but he may live in it long, and be continually inſnared, and turn away to folly; but the more it is thus with thee, the nearer thou doſt come unto Covenant-breaking with the Lord.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhall I do to keep Covenant with the Lord, knowing the falſeneſs and inſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of my ſpirit, the duties are many, and it is impoſſible for me to obſerve them all? Take theſe directions.</p>

Now having entered in this manner into Covenant with God, it is our duty to have reſpect unto our Covenant, and to improve our intereſt in it in all our ways: The Covenant is to run through our whole life; for it's a Covenant for a mans life, it being a Marriage Covenant, and <hi>In matrimonio eſt perpetua quaedam ſervitus, In matrimony there is a perpetual kind of ſervitude;</hi> a <hi>Woman which hath an husband, is bound by the law to her husband as long as he liveth,</hi> Rom. 7.2. and <hi>David</hi> puts all his hope in the Covenant, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. his happineſs conſiſted in it, and all his joy and delight, his ſoul did run out upon this Covenant, and from hence all his joy came in. There are in Scripture ſeveral ways of ſinning againſt this Covenant; (1) There is <hi>tranſgreſſing the Covenant like Adam:</hi> Hoſ. 6.7.<note place="margin">Hoſ. 6.7.</note>

(2) It is <hi>rejecting the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.15. to deſpiſe it as a poor and unworthy thing, not to be regarded by them. (3) There is forſaking the Covenant, as a thing that they are not bound by, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they be bound by any longer.<note place="margin">Deut. 29.25.

(5) There is a <hi>dealing falſly in the Covenant, Pſal.</hi> 44.17. which ſignifies, <hi>to lye to a man,</hi> and <hi>deal treacherouſly</hi> with him in a Covenant made, when a man pretends fair, and doth the quite contrary, there is no truſt to him, no hold upon him.

Expect that God ſhall deal with thee according unto this Covenant, and ſo thou maiſt judge of all his wayes towards thee; for God does always diſpenſe himſelf unto a perſon according to the Covenant under which he ſtands: and this is that which deceives moſt men in the Church, becauſe they hear of the Covenant of Grace, and do live under the outward priviledges thereof; though for the ſtate of their perſons they be under the Covenant of works, yet they expect that Gods dealing ſhould be to them according to the tenour of the ſecond Covenant; and therefore if they do ſin and afterwards ask pardon, they conclude that God will give pardon and grace, and that what ſervices they do, find acceptance with him, and ſhall have from him a reward. It is true, with them that are in

If thou ſin thou maiſt expect pardon, and if thou do duty, thou that art under the ſecond Covenant maiſt expect acceptance, and if thou be afflicted, thou muſt look upon it as an act of the Fathers love; <hi>whom I love I rebuke and chaſten;</hi> and if thou doſt ſin look that God ſhould viſit thy offences with a rod, for God in faithfulneſs doth afflict his own children, and if the frowardneſs of thy heart be not overcome by it, he will put forth an almighty power of loving kindneſs to draw thy heart to him with the cords of thy love;<note place="margin">Eſay 57.</note>

(2) I will give you the grounds why a man ſhould renew his Covenant. (3) Shew the times when in a ſpecial manner the Lord expects it, and when it is a way to find mercy with the Lord.

                  <p n="1">1. A man being once entred into Covenant with God, is held and obliged by that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant for ever; as we ſee the Devils entred into Covenant, and this Covenant they have broken in reſpect of the precept, yet they are all ſtill under the curſe of it, and ſhall be for ever, and that curſe <hi>the chains of darkneſs</hi> in which they are held; ſo man being once ingaged is for ever engaged; therefore it's <hi>his duty often to renew his Covenant:</hi> and that will appear in theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Lord hath often renewed his Covenant with his people; he made a Covenant with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 15.18. and yet he renews his Covenant again, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.2, 4, 7. So the Lord did take <hi>Iſrael</hi> into Covenant with himſelf, and his name was called upon them, he doth take them into their Fathers Covenant, he remembred his Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 6.4, 5, 7.</note> and he ſaith, <hi>I will take you unto me for a people, and I will be to you a God, and you ſhall know that I am the Lord your God,</hi> &amp;c. and yet this Covenant he renews in a publick and ſolemn manner upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> when <hi>out of his mouth went a fiery law,</hi> Deut. 5.2, 3.<note place="margin">Deut. 5.2, 3.</note>

                  <p n="2">2. The people of God have often renewed their Covenant alſo with him; it was not enough that they had in <hi>Moſes</hi> time been taken into Covenant ſo often, but before he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he renewed the Covenant with them, and they did ſolemnly ingage themſelves, <hi>The Lord will we ſerve,</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. But ſeeing that a Covenant once made doth alwayes bind a man and the force of it continues, diſtance of time doth not wear it out, <hi>why ſhould it be needful for</hi> men <hi>to renew
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:52030:108"/> their Covenant ſo often?</hi> The grounds of it are theſe. 1. Becauſe of the unbelief of our ſpirits, and from the infirmity of our faith; for the confirmation of our faith in the mercy and grace of the Covenant. Therefore <hi>David</hi> made it the matter and ground of all his delight, and his thoughts were wholly upon it. Why did God renew the Covenant ſo often with <hi>Abraham,</hi> but to ſtrengthen and confirm his faith therein that it was a ſure Covenant, and ſhould never be forgotten? The mercies of the Covenant are great, and the heart of man would fail and his ſpirit ſink in the expectation of them; but then he calls to mind his Covenant, and renews his Covenant-ingagements with them; and for this cauſe we receive the ſeals of the Covenant often, and every time we do ſo, we renew the Covenant between God and us; Gods ſeals are ſet to our ſeals, that this may be like unto <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s ſtones, a teſtimony that we have entred into Covenant with the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To manifeſt the ſincerity of our hearts, that though we fail in the duty of it, yet our hearts ſtill ſtand to it, we delight in the Law according to our inward man; though we fall every day, yet ſaies a ſoul in Covenant with God, I love to think of renewing the ingagement that is between God and me; as a loving and tender Wife loves often to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new her ingagement to her Husband, and to have it much in her mind, that ſhe may not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the Covenant of her God, ſo to ſhew that a man doth not repent, but his ingagement <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

They renew their Covenant, that by often repeating and renewing it, it may be ſet on upon their ſpirits the more, and lay the greater ingagement upon them; for ſurely the more frequently we bind our ſelves, the faſter we are bound, and every renewal of our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant doth intend and ſtrengthen the obligation, and makes the deeper impreſſion upon the heart; and therefore <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.7. the Lord commands <hi>Iſrael, to teach them diligently unto their children:</hi> the word in the Hebrew is, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="5">5. By reaſon of the forgetfulneſs of the heart; there is nothing that the ungodlineſs of a mans heart is more prone to than to forget his ingagement unto God; and therefore was that ſtrict charge laid upon them, Deut. 4.23. <hi>Take heed to your ſelves leſt you forget the Covenant which the Lord your God made with you, and make you a graven Image,</hi> &amp;c. The happineſs of the Angels lies in this, that they both know all the duties of their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and have them alwaies in mind; for where there is no ſinfulneſs, there is no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs; but the miſery of man lies in this, as to the ingagement of this Covenant in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things he is ignorant of it, ſo alſo is he unmindful of it; and thence the Apoſtle ſaith, Heb. 2.1, 2. <hi>Leſt we prove leaking veſſels,</hi> &amp;c. or as ſome will derive the word,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.1, 2.</note>

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:52030:109"/> this cauſe he has appointed a weekly remembrance; and the death of Chriſt he would not have to be forgotten, and therefore he appoints us to remember it often; <hi>do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me;</hi> becauſe it would elſe quickly wear out of our minds; mercies and duties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the moſt part written in our hearts as letters written upon the water, no ſooner in, but out: and therefore we read in <hi>Eſay</hi> 48.8. when the Lord would have a thing take deep impreſſion upon them, he bids them <hi>to remember it, yea bring it again to mind:</hi> O ye tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, not only remember it once, but often bring it again to mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now there is a double curſe upon the memory of man. (1) There is a natural weakneſs, that it is like a Sieve that lets paſs all the Corn, and retains nothing but the Chaff. (2) There is a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is below nature: As there is a ſtrength unto good that is ſupernatural, when a man is immediately acted by the Spirit of God, that there is in him more than the ſtrength of a man; ſo there is alſo in wayes of ſin, when a man hath an immediate concurrence of the ſpirit of the Devil,<note place="margin">Rev. 2.10.</note> Joh. 8.44. <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devil, and his luſts ye will do:</hi> and <hi>the Devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into priſon,</hi> that is, wicked men acted by the ſpirit of the Devil; and ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11. the Dragon is the Heathen <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, but it is as they are acted by Satan; and therefore it is ſaid to be the <hi>old Serpent and Satan in them;</hi> for the Devil hath not in himſelf ten horns, it is the Devil working in them and acting them; ſo there is alſo a weakneſs below nature, men are apt to forget the word, and their duty which they learn out of it, but Satan comes and as an Harpy ſnatcheth away the word, that is, he adds a weakneſs below the nature, men are apt to forget it ſooner than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would have done, by putting into the heart contrary impreſſions: the things that we regard and take care of, we are apt to remember, but the things that we care not for, we are apt to forget; <hi>quae curant ſenes meminerunt, old men remember what they care for.</hi> Now the heart of man is leaſt ſet upon Covenant duties of any thing, and therefore had need to have its memory helped with <hi>continual</hi> and frequent repetitions of them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. By reaſon of the ignorance and blindneſs of the mind of man, we had need to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred of our Covenant, and to renew it often: we are all narrow mouthed veſſels, and receive all things from God but by drops, and light comes in upon us but by degrees in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral beams, and a man looks often upon it before he can underſtand it; and therefore the Lord gives unto us <hi>line upon line, and precept upon precept,</hi> Eſay 28.10. And thence the Saints of God read over the ſame things, and be content to hear the ſame things again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have a new view of them, they have a farther light into, and farther diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of them;<note place="margin">Pſal. 25.14.</note> Pſal. 25.14. <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him,</hi> the word in Hebrew ſignifies <hi>myſterium &amp; arcanum,</hi> a ſecret is ſomething that cannot be known, unleſs it be by revelation, that a man by all his wiſdom and induſtry could not find out; And what is that ſecret of the Covenant? The Covenant is the ſecret, and it is <hi>with them</hi> that he may make it known unto them, therefore there is a myſterie in the dutys of the Covenant that is not revealed unto all, but it is unto them that <hi>fear him;</hi> and the Lord will do it ſuitably unto our frame; as our grace comes in by conſtant ſupplies of the Spirit of God, ſo doth our knowledge alſo, and all by a daily increaſe of light from the Spirit, and this is by a frequent repetition of the ſame act of faith, and therefore the people of God love to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it, and thereby they ſee farther into theſe myſteries from day to day, and they do the more exceedingly prize the mercy of the Covenant as the greateſt mercy they can injoy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>How is this work to be done, and what is it for a man to renew his Covenant?</hi> 1. He that will renew his Covenant with God, muſt be deeply ſenſible of the breach of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and of the unfaithfulneſs of his heart therein. It ſhould deeply humble us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that no bonds ſhould hold us. If there were no other tye upon us, but that of our creation, that we had our being from him, and that out of nothing; but when unto this natural and neceſſary bond, we have added a voluntary, and have conſented unto the Lord, yet now for us to forget the Covenant of our God, and prove perfidious to him, and draw back, is this your return unto God, for his Grace in taking you into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and who doth always remember Covenant mercies for you, even then, when you forget duty to him? Is this your requital of the Lord, who in the performance of the Covenant did not ſpare his Son, when he cryed that he might be ſaved? God was ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon his Covenant with you, that the death of his Son was a ſacrifice of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour, and he was delighted in it, in performance of the grace of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with you. And alſo the Lord Chriſt met with variety of diſcouragements, not only the weight of ſin in the guilt of it, which he complained of as his own, though he knew no ſin,<note place="margin">Pſal. 40.12.</note> but the wrath of the Father, the rage of his enemies, the hour and the power of darkneſs, the falſhood of his Diſciples; and yet when he was tempted to come down from the Croſs, he doth hold it out, that he might thereby ſhew that he loved
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52030:109"/> you to the uttermoſt, and would ſave you to the utmoſt. And now for you,<note place="margin">Prov. 20.25.</note>

                  <p n="4">4.

                  <p n="1">1.

It's called a <hi>converſion,</hi> Luk. 22.31. <hi>When thou art converted ſtrengthen thy brethren; Recovery out of ſin committed, is called a converſion:</hi> There is a two-fold converſion; (1) from a general ſtate of ſin; (2) from a particular way of ſin: for the firſt of theſe <hi>Peter</hi> had paſt, he was converted before, and Chriſt had given teſtimony to his faith, that it was true, and that it ſhould not fail; but yet there is a converſion from this particular fall, a renewing of his repentance, and as it were turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto God again a-new, and that is ſeen in theſe two things. [1] In renewed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and godly ſorrow. [2] In a renewed Covenant, and a ſolemn ingagement of reformation for the time to come; and this is required in the renewing of a mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance after any great and eminent fall. The ſame courſe doth <hi>Paul</hi> take, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.16. after his conflict, he doth then renew his Covenant, and ſaith, <hi>I do break the Law, yet my heart doth ſtill cleave to the rule thereof, and acknowledge the goodneſs of it:</hi> and this conſent of ſpeaking the ſame thing that the Law doth, is properly and formally the renewing of a mans Covenant and ingagement, and ſo doth the Church after her great fall and backſliding, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.3. <hi>I am my beloveds, and my beloved is mine, he feedeth among the lillies;</hi> which I conceive to be the words of one rejoycing and triumphing in the aſſurance of his intereſt in God; but alſo they are the words of one covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and renewing the reconciliation of himſelf unto the Lord; as when the Lord hath departed from us, through our provocation, when he doth return to his people, he is ſaid to elect them anew: <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.17. <hi>The Lord ſhall yet comfort Sion, and ſhall yet chuſe Jeruſalem;</hi> his returning is as it were a ſecond election: So when we return to God after a ſpecial fall, it is, as it were, a new converſion: and this is a ſpecial teſtimony of the truth of a mans ſorrow, that it is according to God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In time of publick <hi>humiliation;</hi> when men would divert and turn away judgement either from a nation or a perſon, then is the time for them to renew their Covenant; and this was the ground of the Covenant the <hi>Hezekiah</hi> made:<note place="margin">2 Chron. 29.8.</note> 
                     <hi>Our fathers have tranſgreſſed, and done that which was evil in the ſight of the Lord; wherefore the wrath of the Lord
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:52030:110"/> came upon Judah and Jeruſalem, to deſtroy them, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to aſtoniſhment, and to hiſſing; as you ſee with your eyes, our fathers have fallen by the ſword, and our ſons, and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this; now it is in my heart, to make a Covenant with the Lord God of Iſrael, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.</hi> The end of his making the Covenant, was to divert the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And ſo we read alſo in the Book of <hi>Nehemiah:</hi> and thus gracious is the Lord,<note place="margin">Nehem. 9.38.</note> that when he doth ſend judgement for ſin, he doth not continue the judgement, but till he doth ſee an humiliation and reformation in act; let there be but the ſerious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of reformation, and let the Covenant be renewed to ingage the ſoul thereunto, and the Lord doth remove the judgement; and when the will is in his people, he doth accept it for the deed, as <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 32.5. <hi>I ſaid, I will confeſs my ſin unto the Lord, and the Lord forgave me my ſin;</hi> and the prodigal Son doth but ſay, <hi>I will go to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and while he was yet a great way off, the father met him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. In a time of publick <hi>reformation,</hi> when the foundations have been deſtroyed, and all things out of courſe, and a great deal of difficulty appears, and even impoſſibility in carrying on the work; yet the people of God looking upon it as a duty, have ſet upon it with full reſolution and purpoſe of heart, and have covenanted to go through with the work, notwithſtanding all oppoſition. <hi>Jehoiada</hi> made a Covenant between the Lord, and the King and the people, that they ſhould be the Lords people; here Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was corrupted, and Dominion was uſurped, and the Lord put it into the heart of <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the Prieſt, to endeavour the reformation of both: and therefore he brought forth the Kings Son, to whom the government did rightly belong, and did ſet him up in the Throne, and depoſed <hi>Athalia</hi> the uſurping Queen; and he doth make a double Covenant, (1) A Covenant between God, and the King and the People; and in this Covenant, the King and the people do make up but one party; and they ingage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be Gods people, and the King to rule for God, as under him. (2) There is alſo a Covenant between the King and the People, that he ruling for God, and under God, they will for Conſcience ſake obey. Now my Covenant with any Magiſtrate muſt be underſtood, as being a ſecond and ſubordinate Covenant; I am ſo to keep Covenant with them, that I muſt alſo keep my Covenant with the Lord. Wherefore, after they had thus ſtrengthened themſelves by a Covenant, in the next verſe they ſet upon the work of reformation effectually; for all the people of the land went into the houſe of <hi>Baal</hi> and brake it down. And ſo did <hi>Joſiah,</hi> he made a Covenant with the Lord, <hi>To walk after the Lord, and keep his Commandments with all his heart;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 King. 23.3, 4.</note> and then he commanded them to bring out of the Temple of the Lord, all the Veſſels that were made for <hi>Baal, &amp;c.</hi> and wrought the moſt glorious reformation that ever 'was by any of the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> having his heart and hands ſtrengthened by a Covenant with the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As a teſtimony of a mans <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> for any great mercy or ſpecial deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; or as an argument of faith that a man is to uſe unto God, when he doth pray for, and expect from God any ſpecial mercy. (1) As an argument that a man ſhould uſe unto God to obtain mercy; it is that artificial way of praying, that the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf teaches his people, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14.2. <hi>Take away our iniquity, and receive us graciouſly, ſo will we render the calves of our lips. Aſſur ſhall not ſave us, we will not ride upon Horſes, neither will we ſay any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our Gods; for in thee the fatherleſs find mercy,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo <hi>Jacob</hi> alſo, Gen. 28.20, 22. he begged a bleſſing in his journey, and he doth follow the prayers he had put up with a vow, <hi>if the Lord will be with me, he ſhall be my God, and if he bring me to my Fathers houſe, this Stone ſhall be Gods Houſe, and if the Lord bleſs me with an eſtate, I will ſurely return him of his own, I will give the tenth unto thee;</hi> ſo punctual is this holy man to reſtipulate or return ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unto God anſwerable unto the mercy that he doth beg of God. If <hi>Hezekiah</hi> may be delivered from death, <hi>Eſay</hi> 38.20. and <hi>David</hi> from guilt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.14.</note> they promiſe to <hi>ſing aloud of ſo great a mercy,</hi> and <hi>to teach tranſgreſſors the way of God,</hi> alſo the Fathers to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall declare his truth. When a man in deſiring the mercy doth it with a ſpiritual eye, and doth not ask amiſs, he is truly careful to perform the duty that ſuch a mercy calls for, that he may return as well as receive, for <hi>quantum à praeceptis tantum ab au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus Dei ſumus,</hi> Tertullian. When there is no obedience to God, there muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected no audience by God. And therefore one ſpecial argument that the people of God do uſe in their prayers to obtain mercy, is a renewing their Covenant. (2) It is to be done in teſtimony of thankfulneſs for mercy received: and then doth a man indeed make a right uſe of a mercy, when he is bound the cloſer unto God by ſuch cords of Love; and the more the Lord doth ingage him, the more he is willing to ingage himſelf to God. A great
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:52030:111"/> army of <hi>Ethiopians</hi> came againſt the King of <hi>Judah</hi> with an hoſt of a thouſand thouſand men, and the Lord delivered them into his hand; now at their return they came to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to give God the glory of the victory, and they offered unto him of the ſpoil which they had taken, and now they enter into Covenant with the Lord to ſeek the Lord God of their Fathers with all their hearts, and with all their ſouls; and ſo the renewing of the Covenant is their return made unto God for the mercy. And ſo the Jews at their return out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Jer. 50.4, 5. <hi>They come with weeping, and ſeek the way to</hi> Sion <hi>with their faces thitherward, and they ſay, Let us bind our ſelves unto the Lord by a perpetual Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant never to be forgotten;</hi> ſo that in receiving and attaining the mercy, God calls for a Covenant, as alſo in returning the mercy.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When a man finds his heart bent to <hi>backſliding,</hi> and he is unſteady and unſtable in any good way: <hi>Moſes</hi> finding the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> a very unſteady people, and whoſe hearts were not ſtedfaſt with the Lord, after that ſolemn Covenant with them upon Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> he renews it again a little before his death, when they were come to the borders of the promiſed Land, and inforceth it both with the wonders that God wrought upon <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> and alſo the great miracles that he had wrought for them, when he led them through the wilderneſs forty years. And the ſame thing was the ground of <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s renewing his Covenant,<note place="margin">Joſh. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. And <hi>Nehemiah</hi> finding that many of the Jews loved their ſtrange Wives, and the children that they had by them, and therefore it would be hard to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to put them away, having convinced them of the ſin, and obtained of them a promiſe that they would put them away, he doth bind them by a Covenant, which they ſubſcribe, ſeal and confirm by an Oath and a curſe; for he that will keep Covenant with God may ſometimes be ſmitten in the place of Dragons, and ſometimes his Father and his Mother may ſtand in the way of his duty to God; when he ſhould keep the Covenant, they may perſwade him to break it; now this is praiſe-worthy for a man with <hi>Levi</hi> to ſay to his Father and Mother, <hi>I have not ſeen him,</hi> not to know his own Brethren, nor his own Children.<note place="margin">Deut. 33.9.</note> A man had need have his heart ſtrengthned by all manner of Covenant ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or elſe he will do as the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did about putting away their ſervants, <hi>Jer.</hi> 34.9. go back again and behave himſelf falſly and unſteadily therein.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. When a man doth receive the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> any of the ſeals of the Covenant, it is his duty to renew the Covenant: as often as we ſet to the ſeal anew, we ſhould read over the obligation anew.<note place="margin">Gen. 15.18.</note> The Lord made a Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> but yet <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1, 2, &amp;c. the Lord renews the Covenant, and the occaſion of it was, <hi>v.</hi> 10. becauſe the Lord did then inſtitute the Sacrament of Circumciſion, the ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. when the Lord inſtitutes the ſeal he renews his Covenant, and ſo ſhould we as often as we ſet to the ſeal.<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.5.</note> So Pſal. 50.5. <hi>Gather my Saints together to me that have made a Covenant with me by Sacrifice;</hi> there is a double ſenſe given of it, ſome ſay it is a deſcription of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom the Lord owned to be his people, becauſe in Covenant with him by ſacrifice:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod. 24. Calvin:</hi> Sigilla &amp; Syngraphae ſc. adminicula ad ſaciendum Dei foedus.</note> others think it to be ſpoken by way of oppoſition to them that did reſt only in the outward rites, the Sacrifices that they did offer, and did never look upon them as ſigns and ſeals or adminiſtring helps to the eſtabliſhment of Gods Covenant; they did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe the ſacrifices unto the end for which the Lord appointed, or did look upon them as a renewing of their Covenant with God, and their ingagement unto him for their obedience. And ſo it ſhould be in every ordinance of God; theſe acts of obedience ſhould lead us unto the Covenant which is the ground of our obligation unto the ſame obedience; this is true of Baptiſm alſo,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.21.</note> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. which I conceive to be an alluſion unto <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the people firſt confeſſed their ſins and renounced them, and afterwards inquired into the work that they were to do in promiſing and ingaging themſelves unto obedience, and ſo there was a reſtipulation on their part unto God again. And ſo it is true of the Lords Supper, it is the New-Covenant or Teſtament in his blood.</p>
                  <p>Now the fruit and benefits that the people of God have found by the renewing of their Covenant are many.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It hath been a teſtimony to them of the truth of their repentance, <hi>Math.</hi> 3.8. <hi>John</hi> calls for <hi>fruits meet for repentance;</hi> and what is a right fruit of repentance, but to abhor the former evils we have been guilty of, and ſay, <hi>Aſhur</hi> ſhall not ſave us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to engage to perform the contrary duty; for it is not teſtimony enough of the truth of a mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that he doth abſtain from the acts of former ſins, unleſs alſo he has a teſtimony unto his own ſoul that he doth endeavour to grow in the contrary graces.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is the foundation of conſolation. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.14, 15. in the time of <hi>Aſa</hi> the King of <hi>Judah,</hi> they ſwore with a loud voice, with Trumpets and Cornets, and all <hi>Judah</hi> rejoyced at the oath, for they had ſworn with all their hearts. A day of renewing Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the Lord will be a day of great rejoycing and great conſolation unto the ſsoul;
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:52030:111" rendition="simple:additions"/> for it's like unto a new Wedding-day, the Covenant with God being a Matrimonial Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and it brings the ſoul from its wandrings unto God again, and the ſoul ſays, <hi>I will return to my former Huſband, for it was better with me then than now.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a means to eſtabliſh and ſtay the heart, which is in it ſelf exceeding fickle and uncertain: it's unſtable as water. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.31. they bound themſelves by Covenant, to ſerve the Lord, and they did it all the days of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and the Elders that had out-lived him, that had ſeen the great mercies of God unto them, and their bonds and ingagements to God. So <hi>Joſiah</hi> made them <hi>all ſtand to the Covenant,</hi> and all his days they departed not from following the Lord the God of their Fathers; for Jer. 13.11.<note place="margin">2 Chron. 34.33.</note> 
                     <hi>As a girdle cleaves to the loyns of a man, ſo have I cauſed to cleave unto me the whole houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that they might be to me for a name, and a praiſe, and a glory:</hi> there is a principle of fixing and eſtabliſhing in the Covenant, that a man is thereby bound to cleave to God with full purpoſe of heart, there is no going back, therefore it is called the <hi>bond of the Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It's a ſpecial means joyned with faſting and prayer to prevail with God for mercy, when a man is willing as well to ingage himſelf to duty, as he is to expect mercy from the Lord; <hi>they ſought the Lord with their whole deſire, and he was found of them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Chron. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>and the Lord gave them reſt round about:</hi> and there is no more effectual way to obtain any bleſſing or mercy from God, than a renewing of Covenant and ingagement of obedience to God.

What more effectual courſe can any take to avoid the croud of temptations, which in this vain dirty world he is ſurrounded with, than by giving up his heart entirely to God? And how can this be accompliſhed, but by frequent renewings of his Covenant with God?

                  <p n="8">8. The principal part of the ſouls Communion and walking with God as a friend, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in this renewing its Covenant with God. The Apoſtle exhorts us, Col. 2.6. <hi>As we have received Chriſt Jeſus, ſo to walk in him:</hi> and what doth he mean hereby? Is it not as if he had ſaid; do you not remember with what a ſtrong inviolable aſſent and conſent, you at firſt received Chriſt? What paſſionate, flaming, deep and pure affections you then had for him? How much you hugged and embraced him in the bent of your wills? What complacence and ſatisfaction you then took in thoſe mutual embracements between him and you? How ambitious you were of ſhewing all friendly and obſequious deportment towards him? O! then be exhorted to receive him afreſh day by day, by repeated conſent and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, walk in him in the ſame manner and with the ſame repeated acts of election, as you at firſt received him. Herein the main of Communion lies.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The frequent renewing of our Covenant with God is the moſt ſoveraign means to prevent or recover the ſoul out of any courſe of backſliding.

How was he again converted, but by putting forth the ſame acts of cloſing with Chriſt in a Covenant-way, which he at firſt converſion put forth? And is not the ſoul hereby alſo preſerved from backſliding? Thus the Church, Pſal. 44.17, 18. <hi>All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falſly in thy Covenant: our heart is not turned back. Neither have we dealt falſly.</hi>

How ſoon would her heart have ſtarted back, if ſhe had not bound it faſt to God by her repeated Covenants?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> It is <hi>principium operandi, a ground of working, of reformation and emendation of life.</hi> And it is in the ſtrength of their Covenant that they go forth againſt all ſelf-love of their own hearts, and againſt all the oppoſition that they might meet withall from men. So in <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s time when they came to put away their Wives and Children, their hearts had need be ſtrengthned unto ſuch a work, and therefore by a Covenant they bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thereunto, and ſeal and ſubſcribe it, and ratifie it by an oath and a curſe: and in all their reformation in <hi>Aſa</hi>'s time, and <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s, and <hi>Joſiah</hi>'s, the beginning of all their great actions were undertaken by a Covenant, that thereby they might ingage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto God, and nothing might divert and turn them back from the work that they had undertaken; and therefore we ſee it is not in vain for a perſon or a people to renew their Covenant with the Lord. The Lord grant there may ever be ſuch a frame of heart in us, that we may alwayes live in the comfort of that word, <hi>the Lord has made with us an everlaſting Covenant in all things ordered and ſure, for this is all my ſalvation and all my deſire;</hi> as he ſaid, who was a man after Gods own heart; and this is the hope and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the children of God.</p>

                  <p n="1">§ 1. THE ſubject we have in hand is the Doctrine of the Covenant of Grace, the new and better Covenant; and therein having ſhewed the Perſon that made the Covenant with man, and ſpoken of the free Grace of God, which was the Fountain from whence this Covenant of Grace did flow, we came in the next place to conſider the Perſons with whom this Covenant was made, and they are ſet down in a threefold ſubordination: (1) Firſt and immediately with Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam:</hi> (2) In him with all the Faithfull: (3) In them with their Seed. And this laſt is the head we are now to enter upon, having laid theſe two grounds: (1) That the Covenant that God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> is the ſame Covenant that all the Faithfull, whether Jews or Gentiles, ſtand under to the worlds end;<note place="margin">Rom. 4.16.</note> therefore is <hi>Abraham</hi> called <hi>the Father of us all;</hi> though of the Gentiles: <gap reason="foreign">

(2) Though in the manner of the Adminiſtration of this Covenant there be a great deal of difference from what it was in ancient times, yet as to the ſubſtance of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the perſons that are <hi>foederati</hi> in it, are the ſame, and taken in upon the ſame grounds, and ſhall be ſo to the end of the world; and therefore as the ſeed were taken into Covenant with their father, the ſame way will the Lord diſpenſe the Covenant to the end of the world, that if he take the Parent into Covenant he will take the ſeed with him; and therefore their children are called <hi>the Sons of the Covenant;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 3.25.</note> becauſe it's as a Birth-Priviledge, and belongs unto them as they are taken into their Fathers Covenant: And this the Lord ſays ſhall be the way in which he will diſpenſe his Covenant for ever;<note place="margin">Act. 2.39.</note> that no man may ſay this was a peculiar priviledge unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed onely; for <hi>Abraham</hi> is made the Father of many Nations,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.12.</note> the Father of the Circumciſion and of the Uncircumciſion, and the Promiſe is to you and your ſeed, and unto them that are afar off, as Gentiles unconverted are ſaid to be, that are yet ſtrangers unto the Church of God,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.17.</note> and the Priviledges thereof, even to as many as in all ages the Lord ſhall call.

                  <p>A point it is of great concernment, and therefore to be contended earneſtly for: 1. As
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:52030:113"/> that which doth exceedingly advance the Grace of God unto <hi>Parents,</hi> and makes much for their Conſolation that are Believers, that not only the Lord doth extend mercy to them, but to their ſeed, as he did here extend it to <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, by which God exceedingly exalts his free Grace, and ſo it's made an argument of ſpecial Love unto Parents, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.37. <hi>Becauſe he loved thy Parents, therefore he choſe their ſeed after them;</hi> Mercy unto their Poſterity is from the Love of God unto Parents: Now as it is a ſpecial Grace of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Covenant, that wherever Believers come, unto all people where they live they ſhall be a bleſſing;<note place="margin">Gen. 12.2.</note> the word in the Hebrew is <gap reason="foreign">

Now it were a great terrour to a man, that while he is under the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant his iniquity ſhall be viſited upon his Children, if when he is tranſlated into the ſecond Covenant, the grace of the Covenant ſhould no way extend unto them; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p n="2">2. This is one of the great Arguments that the Scripture uſeth to draw men in to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, becauſe not only they ſhall have benefit by it, but their Poſterity: there is a double uſe that I find the Apoſtle makes of that argument: (1) To the Children as a means to bring them in; <hi>repent ye therefore and be converted,</hi> for you are the children of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which God made with your fathers; there is mercy in a ſpecial manner offered to you, and unto you firſt, becauſe you are the children of the Covenant, and therefore have in a ſpecial manner a right to it. (2) To the Parents, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you in the Name of the Lord Jeſus for the remiſſion of ſins, for the promiſe is to you and your children;</hi> not only you ſhall have benefit by it, but your children upon whom you have brought a curſe, and therefore were not <hi>parentes ſed peremptores,</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks of all men in reference to their children in a ſtate of nature; they alſo ſhall have benefit by it, and by your laying hold of the Covenant be brought in under the ſame Covenant with you; your children, that are now children of the curſe, they ſhall become children of the Covenant. Now as it ſhould be a great argument to keep men from ſin, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they wrong their Poſterity, it's a Treaſon that taints the blood; ſo it ſhould be a great engagement unto all Parents to come within the Covenant, that the Grace of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant might alſo be extended in them unto all their ſeed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This is the great and only difference that God hath put in his Word between the children of Believers within the Covenant of Grace, and the ſeed of Strangers who are ſtrangers to the Covenant; that their children belong unto the Family of God, and are own'd by God as ſuch in a viſible way; whereas all the reſt of the Families of the world, that are Unbelievers, belong to the Kingdom of Satan, and are to be looked upon as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out;<note place="margin">Deut. 4.37.</note> and therefore, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.37. <hi>the Lord choſe their ſeed after them;</hi> it's not ſpoken of an Election to ſalvation; but there is an Election to Priviledges, as well as to Life, and yet both flow from a ſpecial Love; for there is but a two-fold Kingdom, of God, and of the World; and of theſe there is a two-fold God, there is Satan the God of this world, and all they that are in this Kingdom have for their God the God of this world; but there is a Kingdom of God, and all that are in that Kingdom the Lord has taken to be his people, and they have in a peculiar manner the Lord for their God, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> had the Name of God call'd upon them, and they only had the means of ſalvation; for <hi>ſalvation is of the Jews,</hi> and the Lord did take them as his <hi>peculiar Treaſure,</hi> and did avouch them to be his people, above all people of the earth, they were under more glorious Adminiſtrations, under a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Providence and care above all people of the earth, and yet many of them, nay the greateſt part of them wicked, and but a remnant amongſt them according to the Election

It's the only ground that I know that Believers can have of the ſalvation of their children, if they dye in their infancy; I do not now ſpeak of Gods ſecret counſel; for <hi>the foundation of God ſtands ſure, having this ſeal, The Lord knows who are his;</hi> and what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he has belonging unto the Election of Grace amongſt them that are afar off we know not, <hi>ſecret things belong to God;</hi> but we find no promiſe of ſalvation made unto any out of the viſible Church of God; <hi>ſalvation is of the Jews,</hi> and 'tis Gods promiſe that is to be the rule of our faith, and the ground of our hope, and not our counſel.<note place="margin">Joh. 4.</note> Now if the children of believing parents be not taken into Covenant with their parents, they have no more a promiſe of ſalvation than the children of a Pagan.

Now as long as a perſon is a viſible Member of the Kingdom of Chriſt, and under a promiſe of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation that the Lord will be his God, I have no reaſon or ground out of the Word to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion their election or ſalvation, but rather in the judgment of charity grounded upon the Covenant to hope and believe, or be perſwaded of the ſame, till they viſibly manifeſt the contrary, though there may be ſome Reprobates amongſt them: on the contrary, though we know Chriſt gathers his Elect out of the Kingdom of Satan, and therefore many of the Elect remain yet under his power, yet I have no ground to hope of any particular perſon, that he is elected of God, being ſtill under Satans Kingdom, till he give ſome teſtimony of the contrary; for either all infants dying in infancy muſt be ſaved, or they muſt all be damned, or elſe there muſt be a difference by grace put between them that are ſaved, and them that are damned; for in nature there is no difference. Now what difference the Lord may put in his ſecret counſel we know not, but there is no difference put in his word, but that which is grounded on the Covenant under which they ſtand, being taken into it together with their parents. What ground had a Jew, if his child died, to hope its ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but that God promiſed to be his God, and the God of his ſeed alſo? and the ſame ground has a Chriſtian to hope the ſalvation of all his that die in their infancy; becauſe the Covenant is the ſame with both, and the perſons taken into Covenant are the ſame, <hi>Thou and thy ſeed after thee.</hi>

                  <p>This truth therefore we had need to be carefully inſtructed in, and which has ſtirred up thoſe that are faithful unto God and his Truth to contend earneſtly for this Doctrine as delivered unto, and this priviledge as conferred on the Saints, againſt thoſe that would put their children into the ſame condition with thoſe who are fartheſt off from God;<note place="margin">Jude 3.</note> ſo that though they be the children of their fleſh, yet they are not of their Covenant.

(2) There is <hi>ſurrogated Iſrael,</hi> thoſe that are grafted in, when they were broken off; therefore as the other did grow upon the root of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant, ſo do theſe alſo, for they were gathered in, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17. that is, as <hi>Beza</hi> renders it, for thoſe<note n="*" place="margin">Pro ipſis in locum ramo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum defracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note>

                  <p n="2">2. When the parents are diſinherited and caſt out of the Covenant, ſo are the children alſo; therefore when the parents are taken in, the children are taken in, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. we read of a breaking off and a grafting in. Now the breaking off and grafting in muſt anſwer to and expound one the other: now how were they <hi>natural branches?</hi> They were ſo called by reaſon of their birth, growing naturally upon <hi>Abraham</hi> the root. How were they <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off?</hi> They were rejected from being a viſible Church, the Lord called them <hi>Loammi,</hi> and would owne them for his people no more, deprived them of the adoption which did before belong unto them; they were formerly counted the people of God above all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions under Heaven,<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 2.16.</note> but now rejected: and this the Apoſtle calls <hi>wrath come upon them to the uttermoſt:</hi> men that are members of the inviſible Church cannot be broken off, their ſins, though they may <hi>vaſtare conſcientiam,</hi> yet they cannot <hi>excutere fidem, &amp;c.</hi> So then as the Lord took in the believing Gentiles and their children into a viſible Church unto himſelf, and tranſlated the adoption unto them, ſo he did caſt off the Jews and their children, he broke off the natural branches, that they ſhould be unto him no longer as a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; ſo that together with their fathers, the children were broken off; therefore toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their parents the children of the Gentiles are grafted in, and therefore all is put upon the parents Covenant; for their oppoſition to the Goſpel the Lord laid this great wrath upon them and their poſterity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Children are members of the viſible Church where their parents are in Covenant with God: <hi>grafting in</hi> is admiſſion into viſible memberſhip, as <hi>breaking off</hi> is a caſting out of viſible memberſhip: ſo <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Of ſuch</hi> (not only of theſe very little ones, but of ſuch as theſe) <hi>is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Now by the Kingdom of Heaven is meant the viſible Church, and it's commonly ſo put in the Goſpel, ſo that of ſuch is the viſible Church of God conſtituted and made up; therefore little children born in the Church are by Chriſt counted as thoſe of whom the Church and Kingdom of Chriſt in part conſiſts. Now all men by nature are children of wrath, and enemies to God, ſtrangers to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Iſrael;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 2.12.</note> there is no difference, but only by virtue of the Covenant of grace, which cannot come upon their own, but only in their parents right; no man is born a member of the Church naturally, but 'tis a birth-priviledge that comes upon them by grace through their parents Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Hence it comes to paſs, that there is a holineſs comes upon thoſe children of believing parents,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.16.</note> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. <hi>If the root be holy, ſo are the branches; and if the firſt-fruits be holy, the lump is alſo holy;</hi> the root is <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Fathers, and they are ſaid to be the firſt-fruits, becauſe they were firſt conſecrated unto God, and the branches were dedicated in their root,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.14.</note> and the lump in the firſt-fruits; and ſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Elſe were your children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, but now are they holy.</hi> What's the holineſs that is here meant? it's not a perſonal
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:52030:114"/> and inherent holineſs that's here ſpoken of; for the branches that were thus holy were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, which if they had been truly and ſpiritually holy, they could never have been; therefore it's ſpoken only of a federal and derived holineſs from their parents Covenant, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> is called the <hi>holy nation, Exod.</hi> 19.6. and the <hi>holy people, Dan.</hi> 8.24.12.7. that is, a people that God had ſeparated to himſelf of all Nations under Heaven, whom he would in a ſpecial manner owne, and amongſt whom he had ſet up his Ordinances, and would dwell; for federal holineſs is nothing elſe but being ſeparated from the world to become a member of the viſible Church, and thereby to have a right unto the ordinances and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of a viſible member, though he be not truly converted or begotten unto God; and this is called being a <hi>Jew outwardly,</hi> that is, a member of the viſible Church, and to whom the priviledges of a Church-member did belong; but there is a <hi>Jew inwardly,</hi> in whoſe heart there dwells converting grace. Now how doth this holineſs flow, ſeeing that by nature all men are alike unholy, and there is no more ſeparation of one man unto God than another, and one man hath no more right by nature unto viſible and external privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges than another, for all are born in the ſame condition? This is only by virtue of their being taken into their parents Covenant; and becauſe the firſt-fruits are holy, ſo is the whole lump, and becauſe the root is holy, ſo are the branches, there is a holineſs derived from one unto the other.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We meet with very glorious promiſes that God has made to the poſterity of the Saints, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. <hi>The Lord will circumciſe thy heart and the heart of thy ſeed:</hi>

And by nature one man has no more right to a promiſe than another, nor ground to expect it, only the Covenant of God makes the difference, they are all heirs of the promiſes, as they are children of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, This is Goſpel, and therefore to be believed, and laid hold upon as well as any other part of the ſecond Covenant; for <hi>a Believer in the exerciſe of his faith is to take in the whole Covenant, as in the obedience of faith he is to take in the whole Commandment.</hi> A mans faith, if it be ſincere, muſt be univerſal, as well as his obedience: that this is Goſpel, and a Goſpel-promiſe, I ſuppoſe that no man will deny; <hi>I will be thy God and the God of thy ſeed.</hi> Now how does the Lord become the God of the parents? it's only by Covenant; and ſo he is ſaid to be the God of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; he ſaith, <hi>I aſcend unto my God and your God;</hi> and, <hi>My God, my God why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> It's ſpoken with reference unto the Covenant, into which Chriſt had entred with the Lord: now being the parents God in Covenant, he ſays, <hi>He will be the God of their ſeed,</hi> that is, theirs in Covenant alſo. We may obſerve that God hath revealed this as Goſpel, and alſo that the people of God have believed it, and exerciſed their faith upon it as Goſpel in the behalf of their children.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This God has revealed as Goſpel and part of the ſecond Covenant. The firſt diſcovery that we have of the Goſpel in Scripture is that,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">§. 2. Let us now come to take a view of the Reaſons, why the Lord will take children
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:52030:116"/> into their Parents Covenant, and not take in the Parents alone, and leave their children in the condition in which they were by nature: the grounds of it are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To ſhew the Extent of the Grace of the ſecond Covenant: the Lord hath not dealt with men as he did with the Angels, he did make a particular Covenant with every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Angel, but he doth not ſo with men; he has always delighted to take in man into a Covenant made with Parents for them, that men might ſee that Grace prevented them, and that they were engaged unto God, and his Promiſe was out of Grace entailed upon them as a birth-right; and therefore as in the firſt Covenant God takes in <hi>Adam</hi> and all his poſterity, and the ſecond Covenant is made with the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> and all his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſo, that there may be a reſemblance hereof kept in the world, he hath taken in the children into their Parents Covenant, that they may ſee Grace extended beyond their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, even to their poſterity. It's a wonderfull enlargement of the Grace of God in the firſt Covenant, that all the creatures came under man's Covenant; and becauſe they did ſo, therefore they all fell in him, or elſe why ſhould the curſe of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin come upon the creatures? <hi>Curſed be the ground for thy ſake;</hi> And ſo in the Covenant of Grace, there is a Promiſe that they ſhould be all renewed in Chriſt; and therefore the creatures do wait for the manifeſtation of the liberty of the Sons of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.22. becauſe when we ſhall be delivered, then ſhall they be alſo from the bondage of corruption under which now they groan; and thence when God is reconciled to his People, and takes them into Covenant, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Then I will hear the heavens, and they ſhall hear the earth, and the earth ſhall hear the corn,</hi> &amp;c. and if this be a great manifeſtation of grace to take in creatures, which are but a mans ſervants, how much more to take in the children, which are <hi>bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Even as <hi>Noah</hi> curſed <hi>Cham, Gen. 9.25.</hi> and denounced that the bleſſing of the Covenant ſhould never come upon him and his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; There ſhall be no Canaanite in the houſe of the Lord for ever. <hi>Zach. 14.21.</hi>
                     </note> and dearer to them than any creatures can be? And therefore the Lord, out of his abundant and overflowing grace, in the ſecond Covenant, is pleaſed to make the childrens federal intereſt to be the Parents priviledge; and therefore 'tis ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. of <hi>Jacob, that he bleſſed Joſeph;</hi> and wherein did the bleſſing conſiſt? not ſo much upon <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi> perſon, as upon his poſterity, and that was, <hi>that the name of Abraham and Iſaac and Jacob ſhould be called upon his two ſons Ephraim and Manaſſeh:</hi> this is ſpoken only in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Covenant and the benefits thereof, which was to deſcend upon them from their Parents, and it became their right, becauſe it was their Parents priviledge; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though they had other perſonal names, <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> yet this was a name given them from their federal right, and is called <hi>the bleſſing of Joſeph</hi> in his childrens co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-bleſſing; for it is a conveying of the benefit of the covenant, from Gods abundant grace, not only to himſelf, but to his poſterity; and ſo <hi>David</hi> looks upon it, and admires the mercy, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.18, 19. <hi>Lord, who am I and what is my houſe, that thou haſt brought me hitherto? And yet as if this were a ſmall thing in thy ſight, O Lord, thou haſt ſpoke of thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants houſe for a great while to come: and is this the manner of men, O Lord? for thy Word ſake, and according to thy own heart haſt thou done all theſe great things, to make thy ſervant to know them.</hi> It is therefore to manifeſt the extent of the grace of the ſecond Covenant, that God takes in their ſeed; and gracious Parents do exceedingly rejoyce therein in behalf of their Poſterity, and look upon it as a ſpecial priviledge and their childrens peculiar right.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God has ſo ordered the eternal decree of Election, that the great number of the Elect of God do proceed out of the loyns of his own people; and therefore the Promiſes being but the indefinite expreſſions of his D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>crees, they run to parents called, and unto their children, becauſe the great number of them that ſhall be called, are their children. It's true, that God hath a ſeed of Grace that runs through the loyns of the wicked, and the Lord will take Proſelytes from amongſt the Heathen, and they ſhall be added to the Church; but this is not the ordinary way, but a more extraordinary way of ſalvation, and very many of the children of believing parents within the covenant are wicked, which we ſee in <hi>Cain, Cham,</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> yet in their Poſterity hath the Church of God been continued, there is yet a <hi>Seth,</hi> and a <hi>Sem,</hi> and an <hi>Iſaac,</hi> in which their ſeed ſhould be called, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the Election of grace continued: and this doth appear undeniably by this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; the viſible Church of God is made up of Parents in covenant, and of their ſeed; and therefore while the Church of God was <hi>oeconomical</hi> and in families onely, they were the families of thoſe that were in covenant, in which the Church was continued; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it did ſpread into a Nation, they and their ſeed make up a Church unto God. Now though there be many in the viſible Church that are not ordained unto life, for <hi>many are called but few are choſen, and many ſhall ſeek to enter in at the ſtrait gate, and ſhall not be able,</hi> &amp;c. yet the Church inviſible is gathered out of the viſible Church, they are hid there amongſt the Hypocrites and falſe-hearted men as wheat is hid amongſt the chaffe; now the Promiſes of God are ſuitable to his Decrees, and the events anſwer unto both: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:52030:116"/> if the greateſt part of the Elect proceed out of the loyns of a people in covenant, as they do, then the promiſes of the ſecond covenant being but indefinite, it was neceſſary that they ſhould run unto them and to their ſeed, upon whom if you look <hi>diſtributively,</hi> there are many that ſhall periſh, yet if you look upon them <hi>collectively,</hi> you can and may ſee the ſeed of the Lord is there, and there are many amongſt them that are ordained unto life, and the perſons upon whom God has ſet his everlaſting love are amongſt that number, though we know not particularly who they are, that's a ſecret that the Lord has hid in himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To ſhew his peculiar love to their ſeed,<note place="margin">Deut. 7.6, 7, 8. &amp; 10.15.</note> therefore he will gather out of their ſeed a viſible Church; and if ſo, he muſt make with their ſeed a marriage-covenant. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any ſay, Why doth not the Lord leave their children till they enter into covenant themſelves, and give teſtimony of their faith and converſion? The reaſon is, becauſe God will make them a Church to himſelf, and therefore will make a Church-covenant with them. Now the children of believing parents are taken into a viſible Church, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.37. <hi>Becauſe the Lord loved your parents, therefore he choſe their ſeed after them:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">There's a two-fold election as there is a two-fold adoption, an election to life, and unto Church-privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</note> it's not an election to life that is there ſpoken of, but as <hi>Zac.</hi> 2.7. the Lord ſhall yet chuſe <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> as he had rejected them and caſt them off from a Church-ſtate, and called them <hi>Loammi;</hi> ſo now he will chuſe them again in reference to a Church-ſtate. And thus he is to chuſe their children after them, not unto life, for that is grounded only upon his own love unto the perſons of men, but it's ſpoken in reference to a Church-ſtate, which was grounded upon his love unto their parents; therefore when parents were converted, there was a Church in their houſe, and the poſterity and family was looked upon as a Church unto God, and theirs was the Adoption, the priviledges of ſons externally belonged to them, and God owned them for his above all other families in the whole earth: now thoſe that were taken into a Church-ſtate, unto them and their poſterity there did belong a Church-covenant, and that's the meaning of <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16.8. <hi>I entred into covenant with thee, and thou becameſt mine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. This is the ſureſt ground of a mans judgment in reference to perſons, whether it be a private Chriſtian or a choſen Officer. There are ſome perſons to be admitted into the viſible Church, and there are ſome priviledges of the viſible Church that are to be diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by judgment in the perſon that doth diſpenſe or adminiſter them; for we are not ſent to baptize all mankind, nor to adminiſter Sacraments and cenſures unto all mankind, as we are ſent to preach the Goſpel; neither are we to expect a ſatisfactory convincing ground that this perſon is inwardly and ſpiritually holy and ſavingly intereſſed in the covenant of grace, for that we cannot infallibly judge of; but though it cannot come under our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet our judgment muſt not be blind charity, we muſt take the rule of the word, and keep cloſe to it. And what is the ſureſt rule? There are two that are known, either the mans <hi>profeſſion,</hi> or elſe the <hi>promiſe of God</hi> in reſpect of the childs Church-ſtate by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers priviledge. Now as to the firſt of theſe my judgment may be deceived, and I may adminiſter it unto one that hath ſpiritually no right to it, as we ſee in the Scripture, the Apoſtles themſelves were deceived; but Gods promiſe in giving the children an intereſt in the fathers priviledge is a ſure ground to go by, more than any mans believing or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in the world can be for himſelf; and therefore a man is bound to believe, that his ſeed is taken into covenant, and that they do belong to the Election of grace, and are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſtified, ſanctified, adopted, and accepted in Chriſt, till they manifeſt the contrary; and we have more than a negative ground for it, that we know nothing to the contrary; for we have a poſitive ground, and that is the indefinite promiſe which we have cauſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret in the moſt favourable ſenſe; and I am ſure is a more certain ground for me to paſs a judgment upon, than any mans profeſſion can be, ſeeing that I know my judgment is not infallible in either, but I may be deceived in reference to the perſon to whom it's applied: therefore conſider, that (1) Children, while in their infancy, are members of the viſible Church of God. (2) They have always been taken into memberſhip in the ſame Church with their parents, and accounted as of the ſame Church with them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

And <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.19. <hi>I give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven:</hi> it's meant of the Kingdom of Grace here, the Church, and the Kingdom of Glory in Heaven: for he gives him power to bind on earth, and looſe on earth, and promiſes that it ſhall be ratified in Heaven, but yet all Officers are for the viſible Church, and all their power is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in the viſible Church; and though it be for the good of the Elect, the Church of the firſt-born, the Church inviſible, yet that is not the proper place thereof, but Officers are for the viſible Church. So then theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven, that is, not only they ſhall be ſaved, and ſo fill up the Kingdom of glory, but alſo they belong to the Kingdom of grace, and the Subjects of this Kingdom here are members of the viſible Church, they are actually Subjects of this Kingdom. (3) Neither doth he ſpeak of theſe very indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual children, as a priviledge which belonged unto them alone, he by his omniſcience knowing them to be elected of God, but he ſaith, <hi>Of ſuch as theſe are</hi>—delivering it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as an ordinary rule of our judgment in the like caſe of all other children of parents in covenant unto the end of the world; therefore children that are infants are members of the viſible Church, and therefore taken into a Church-covenant with their parents; for by nature no man is a Church-member,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.12.</note> but all ſtrangers to the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and men afar off; for if any man were ſo by nature, then all men by nature muſt be ſo; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's a priviledge by grace that they are taken into their parents covenant, and are members of the ſame Church with them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Children have been always taken into the ſame covenant with their parents, and have been members of the ſame Church with them. When the Lord made a covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> he took in his family to be a Church; when he took in the Jews, he took in their children alſo to <hi>be unto him a holy and a peculiar people;</hi> and when he did caſt out the children of the Kingdom, and did give them a bill of divorce, removing the candleſtick, he did excommunicate and diſinherit their children; and when he takes the Gentiles into covenant alſo, it is with them and with their ſeed in their generations; and therefore the maſter of the family being converted, ſalvation is come to his houſe, and there is a Church in his houſe, his family becomes of thoſe of whom the viſible Church is conſtituted; for the Gentiles were grafted in as the Jews were broken off, and that was in reference to a Church-ſtate for themſelves and their poſterity; and ſo were the Gentiles grafted into a Church-ſtate for themſelves and their poſterity; and the Lord has given us a rule for it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.14.<note place="margin">Deut. 29.14, 15.</note> when he enters into a Church-covenant with that people and with their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones, that they ſhould be a people unto himſelf, that is, a Church unto God, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>Neither with you only do I make this covenant, but alſo with him that is not here with us this day.</hi> If you underſtand it of the Jews only, this leaves to us theſe two things. (1) That children are included in their fathers covenant, though they be not of themſelves able to reſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. (2) That it is the will of God it ſhould not only be ſo at that time, but in after-ages with them and their ſeed in their generations. But if we underſtand by [them that are not here this day] all that ſhall be taken into the ſame covenant in time to come (as it may be) then it will leave a door open to bring in all the believing Gentiles and their ſeed to the end of the world. Thus the Lord out of love unto the parents doth take not only them, but their ſeed alſo into a viſible Church, that they may be a holy and a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto himſelf.</p>

I ſhall not now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether in the Church <hi>radicaliter, radically,</hi> and in the Officers <hi>formaliter, formally,</hi> &amp;c. as ſome do ſpeak; but (1) the uſe of thoſe Kyes is <hi>to bind and looſe,</hi> that is, to open and ſhut the Kingdom of Heaven, either to receive men in, or to caſt men out; for ſurely they that have authority to caſt out, have power to take in, and it is an authoritative act to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit as well as to eject, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (2) It's an act that is to be denied unto none that have right to admiſſion; if ſo, the power of the Keys is abuſed, for it is not uſed unto that end for which it was appointed by the Lord; for all the Churches power is but <hi>miniſterial,</hi> and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:52030:117"/> muſt be according to Chriſts order; therefore as to caſt them out that ought not to be caſt out, as the Phariſees did, if any man confeſſed Chriſt he ſhould be put out of the Synagogue, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.22. and <hi>Diotrephes, Joh.</hi> 3.10. he caſt them out of the Church, and Antichriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.7. he caſt them out, no man ſhould buy and ſell that had not the mark of the beaſt; and to keep them in that ought to be caſt out, as the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> and <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2. as to be able to bear them that are evil, and not reject them is an abuſe of Church-power; ſo not to admit thoſe that ought to be admitted, and have a right to it, is but an abuſe of the ſame power. (3) It's a power therefore to be exerciſed with judgment, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12. we judge them that are within. It's true, a <hi>judgment of certainty and infallibility</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, and therefore it's commonly called a <hi>judgment of charity;</hi> but yet that muſt be more than a good hope, or ſome negative judgment, <hi>that I judge ſo, becauſe I know nothing to the contrary,</hi> there muſt be a good rule, and ſomething poſitive, that muſt be the ground of this judgment, it muſt be a <hi>judicious charity,</hi> ſomething there muſt be that may be a ground to build a judgment upon, that a man may be able to ſay by this rule, <hi>I admit this perſon, and open Heaven to him, and by this rule I do not admit of another.</hi> Thoſe that I cannot know to have a title to memberſhip, I cannot in faith, by the power of the Keys, admit; therefore if it be done in faith, it muſt be an act of judgment, and I muſt have a ground to go by therein. (4) In <hi>admiſſion,</hi> the Lord that has always loved variety, has taken two ways; ſome are in covenant by their own perſonal right, and ſome have been taken into the Church by their parents right, and as it were their birth-priviledge, being born of parents in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; as all the Church of the Jews were taken into a Church-covenant with their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, though they were not able to reſtipulate; and therefore they are called <hi>the Children of the Kingdom,</hi> thoſe born in it; others were men born out of the Church, and as Proſelytes were added thereunto. Now the ground that a man muſt go by in admiſſions of the one and the other, muſt be viſible; for they are admitted into the viſible Church; into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Church their admiſſion is an act of God only, and by a work of faith, which no men are imployed in; therefore it muſt be ſomething viſible; and ſo Chriſt ſays of infants, <hi>Suffer them to come to me;</hi> therefore it might be judged who thoſe infants were of whom was the Kingdom of Heaven, or elſe how ſhould we know to whom this injunction is dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, <hi>Suffer them to come to me and forbid them not?</hi> Now there is a double ground of this judgment ſuitable to the condition; there is the profeſſion of the Adult, and there is the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents covenant and Gods promiſe; in men grown, if they be admitted, the ground of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the mans profeſſion. Now in reference to an inward and ſpiritual right, I may be deceived in both, but I may make as true a judgment upon the one as upon the other; nay I look upon the promiſes of God taking in the children into the parents covenant to be a far greater and ſurer ground of judgment in the one, than any mans profeſſion can be in the other: ſo that the Lord will take them into covenant to ſhew his love to their parents, and this ſhall be the ground of their being a viſible Church of Chriſt, and their being thus taken into covenant ſhall be the ground of a judgment in thoſe that have the power of the Keys for their admiſſion into the viſible Church unto whom of right it does belong.</p>

                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:52030:118"/> was to convey the image that he had received, and the children of <hi>Adam</hi> were taken into his covenant for the ſpiritual part, the grace of the covenant, as well as for the priviledges of it; for the internal as well as for the external. Now the grace of the covenant is not conveyed from parents to children, it is no more <hi>ex traduce</hi> than the reaſonable ſoul is,<note place="margin">Joh. 1.13.</note> they that believe are born, <hi>not of blood, or of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God: why will the Lord have the ſame conveyance ſtill continue for the externals and the priviledges of it, when for the graces of it the intail is cut off for ever?</hi> (9) <hi>How far the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the old Covenant ſhould as a rule determine the adminiſtration of God under the new?</hi> that we may be able to reaſon from one to the other: he did ſo with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his poſterity, therefore he will do ſo with the Saints now; and whether in <hi>Abraham</hi> there were not ſomething perſonal and peculiar to him and his ſeed according to the fleſh, that they only that come in by a claim to the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> cannot take unto themſelves? For <hi>Abraham</hi> in reference to the covenant is ſet forth two ways, either as a <hi>begetting Abraham,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> or as a <hi>believing Abraham;</hi> and whether the priviledges of both the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh, or by promiſe be the ſame? (10) <hi>How far the Jews by virtue of Abrahams Covenant as being his ſeed, and as being taken into a Church-covenant in their parents, being the only viſible Church unto God on Earth, could pretend to a right unto the ordinances and priviledges of the Church of God under the New Teſtament?</hi> For if the parents were in covenant, ſo were their children taken in, at leaſt, into the externals of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. (11) <hi>How children can be ſaid to be taken into Covenant, when they cannot reſtipulate, nor be ſaid to be obliged by their Covenant?</hi> (12) <hi>Seeing there is ſo much dispute about it, were it not much better to leave children out of this claim?</hi> For if they be elected we may reſt quietly in that ſtate, and leave them in the arms of Gods electing love, and reſting upon that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for their eternal ſalvation, <hi>the Lord knows who are his,</hi> and to defer their claim to the covenant, till they themſelves are able to take hold of the covenant, and to give their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thereunto, to give the hand unto the Lord, and then they may claim it with comfort, children from their parents right, and parents for their children, and then we may with comfort ſeal up that which we have good ground upon judgment to conclude to be a mans title and intereſt; and then the parents covenant-intereſt will come in at ſecond hand, and a man having himſelf firſt taken hold and conſented to the covenant in his own perſon, it will be a good argument for a man to plead with God for the mercies and bleſſings of the covenant: <hi>Lord thou art my God, and my fathers God;</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, <hi>Lord I am thy ſervant, and the ſon of thy handmaid:</hi> and ſo the Church, <hi>For thy ſervant Davids ſake turn not away,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Remember the covenant that thou haſt made with Abraham, and Iſaac,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <hi>We judge them that be within, what have we to do to judge thoſe that are without?</hi> We ſee (1) That Church-government is an authoritative thing, a power of judgment, and ſo the Authority of Chriſt is called, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.25. (2) There is a diſtinction of men, ſome are <hi>without,</hi> and ſome <hi>within;</hi> and this is a rule, <hi>Differentia diviſiva eſt etiam conſtitutiva,</hi> there is ſomething therefore that makes them to be without, and ſomething that makes them to be <hi>within;</hi> and this can be nothing but their own perſonal conſent, or their coming in by their fathers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.

                     <hi>Thou haſt caſt me out from the face of the earth, and from thy face,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo the meaning is, a vagabond I ſhall be on the earth, from thy face ſhall I be hid. Of this there's a double interpretation that's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly given, anſwerable to a twofold acceptation of the <hi>face of God:</hi> [1] By Gods <hi>face</hi> is meant Gods favour, love, protection, and all the fruits of favour, as <hi>all men ſeek the face of the Ruler,</hi> and God ſays, <hi>I'le ſhew thee the back and not the face in the day of their calamity.</hi>

[3] It's ſaid, <hi>That whoever did find him would ſlay him. Cain</hi> was therefore a man taken into a Church-covenant together with his parents, though he was but the ſeed according to the fleſh, and ſo he continued, till, for the juſt deſert of his own ſin, he was caſt out, and had an immediate ſentence of Excommunication paſt upon him by God himſelf, the firſt example that we read of in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture of a Church-cenſure; and the ſame is true alſo of <hi>Iſmael,</hi>

                     <hi>Caſt out the bond-woman and her ſon;</hi> ſhe did ſpeak, it may be, <hi>ſenſu ſuo de haereditate facultatum;</hi> but the Lord did carry it higher, as <hi>Pareus</hi> hath obſerved; and he expounds it <hi>de haereditate ſpirituali. Abrahams</hi> family was a reſemblance of the viſible Church, and the ejection was a caſting out of the viſible Church, and is to be underſtood of a viſible caſting out; therefore while <hi>Iſmael</hi> and his mother were in <hi>Abrahams</hi> family they were members, and came under <hi>Abrahams</hi> cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; but when they were caſt out, then they were to be looked upon as people in covenant with God no longer, they could lay no claim to the covenant of <hi>Abraham.</hi> The ſame may be ſaid of the whole Nation of the Jews, who were all taken into a Church-covenant, they and their children, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.12, 14. and yet but a remnant, a very few of them were ſaved and taken into the ſpiritual benefit of the covenant; and thoſe that were not taken in, they and their poſterity were alſo ejected, and the Lord called them <hi>Loammi,</hi> and gave them a bill of divorce to be ſuch as he would owne in way of Church-fellowſhip and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion no longer; and the ſame courſe the Lord takes with the Gentiles alſo, when he removes the <hi>Candleſtick, Rev.</hi> 2.5.<note place="margin">Rev. 2.5.</note> By the <hi>Candleſtick</hi> is meant not only the preaching of the Goſpel and the Ordinances thereof, but the Church it ſelf, for ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20. <hi>the ſeven Candleſticks</hi> are the ſeven Churches; and the Lord would take away his Ordinances, and they and their poſterity ſhould be no more owned by God as his Church and people in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him; ſo that they were broken off as the Jews were.

But yet this is true alſo, that a man who for the ſtate of his perſon is under the Covenant of Works, may yet have a title unto many temporal promiſes, and outward priviledges of the covenant of grace, and receive many benefits thereby; for the benefits of the Covenant of Grace are of three ſorts: (1) <hi>

Now to Jews and Gentiles grace and regeneration are alike contrary by nature; ſo that there are no natural branches, neither is there any grace derived from parents unto children,<note place="margin">Saving grace flows not from any company of men, no not from the inviſible Church, they are only Chriſts, and he only can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them; but Church-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and priviledges are properly the Churches, and by the Church are derived unto all the members thereof, whether they be Elect or Reprobate. <hi>Mic. 3.</hi> ult.</note>

[2] It's ſpoken of an Olive-tree which hath two ſorts of branches, ſome remain in their own Olive-tree, and are never broken off, but ſome there are that are broken off; for as Chriſt ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf as a Vine into a viſible Church, hath both fruitful and unfruitful branches, ſome are in him that bear no fruit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.2. ſo hath the Church of God as an Olive-tree ſome branches that abide, and ſome that are broken off. Now in the inviſible Church there are no branches to be broken off, for <hi>ex ſolis conſtat electis,</hi> it's the Church of the firſt-born whoſe names are written in Heaven; therefore this <hi>Olive-tree</hi> is a viſible Church, and the branches growing in it are viſible members; they that are grafted in are taken into viſible memberſhip; and they that are broken off, are caſt out from a viſible memberſhip: the root of this Olive-tree is <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the Faithful, with whom as it were the Church-covenant did begin; for there was not a covenant made with him only for himſelf, <hi>That the Lord would be his God,</hi> but alſo <hi>the God of his ſeed;</hi> and therefore it's <hi>mercy to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> but <hi>it's truth to Jacob,</hi> and the benefit of their grafting in is this, <hi>they partake of the root and of the fatneſs of the Olive-tree;</hi> the root is <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that in reference unto the Church-covenant made with him and his ſeed; wherefore they are the children of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, and they partake of the fatneſs of Church-bleſſings, priviledges, and ordinances; for that muſt be meant; for it's ſuch a fatneſs that the Jews did partake of that were broken off, and ſuch a fatneſs from which they alſo might be cut off,<note place="margin">verſ. 22.</note> if they continued not in his goodneſs; therefore it muſt be meant of Church-ordinances and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges only, and not of the ſaving graces of the Spirit, which flow immediately from Chriſt, and not from the Olive-tree the Church.</p>

It's true, that the believer living with the unbeliever may be a means of conveying Grace; for grace is as fire that will turn all things into it ſelf; but that I cannot conceive to be the meaning here; for the ſanctification of the unbeliever is an uncertain thing, and many times does not fall out ſo, but the unbeliever is made the worſe, and the more enraged againſt godlineſs thereby; but the Apoſtle does not ſay, <hi>ſhall be ſanctify'd,</hi> as of a thing uncertain, but <hi>is ſanctifi'd,</hi> as of a thing paſt: thence it cannot be meant of true Grace; for this ſanctification <hi>nihil point in infideli,</hi> he is an unbeliever ſtill,

And if it be objected, that <hi>the Child is holy as the Wife is, who is an unbeliever;</hi> for the wife is ſaid to be ſanctified as well as the child, and this is but a holineſs of uſe, as you have interpreted, as all other things are by Grace ſanctified unto the Saints, and all of them tend to their ſpiritual good: In anſwer hereto here we are to conſider, that the Apoſtle does not ſay, that the child is ſanctified unto the Parents, but 'tis ſaid poſitively of their children, <hi>that they are holy.</hi> There is a double holineſs, <hi>ſtatûs &amp; uſus,</hi> of <hi>ſtate and uſe,</hi> the wife is ſanctified unto his uſe, as all other things are by vertue of the covenant of Grace, a bleſſing to him, and ſhall not be a ſnare unto his ſoul, nor a means to pollute and defile his inward man; and ſo is his honour ſanctified, and his eſtate ſanctified, and all things that belong to him; which cannot be ſaid to be holy in themſelves, but ſanctified unto the man: but this of Children is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of their <hi>ſtate;</hi> that they are holy without reſpect unto their Parents uſe, they are ſo counted by God and are to be ſo reputed by men.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>what is this holineſs?</hi> I anſwer firſt Negatively, <hi>what it is not:</hi> 1. It's not ſpoken of a Holineſs of Converſion and Regeneration; for, (1) The Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> came alike upon all Mankind, and by Nature all are alike polluted; and therefore the Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jews and Gentiles, he ſays in this reſpect there is no difference, but even the Elect of God are the children of wrath as well as others;<note place="margin">Rom. 3.22. Epheſ. 2.3, 5.</note> and if the Election of God have not that power upon a man to ſanctifie him, much leſs any relation elſe in the world can have in reference unto Regeneration, till the Spirit of God put forth upon him a work of his Almighty power. (2) This is not ſpoken of Regeneration; for it is a holineſs that comes upon the Child through the Faith of the Parent, whether he be a Believer in verity or in viſibility only; but the holineſs of Regeneration doth not come upon the child any ſuch way; if neither of the Parents do believe, the child is unholy, but if either of them be a Believer, there is from the faith of the believing Parent a holineſs comes upon the Child; but that is not of Regeneration. (3) It's a Holineſs that may be loſt;<note place="margin">Joh. 1.13. Rom. 11.20.</note> for theſe bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches may be broken off, that is, either caſt out with their Parents, as the Church of the Jews were; when the Lord was pleaſed to unchurch them and call them <hi>Loammi,</hi> he did with their Parents caſt out their Children, and they were holy unto God no more; or elſe they may be caſt out and juſtly deprived of their own priviledges by their own perſonal offences, and ſo be caſt off from this eſtate of holineſs: but this cannot be ſaid of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of Regeneration and Converſion, for there a mans holineſs is everlaſting, becauſe a
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:52030:124"/> man receives a ſeed of holineſs and ſanctification, which ſhall never dye, which can never be broken off; for he receives a ſpirit of ſanctification within him, and has not onely an outward reſpect to holineſs put upon him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but there is many a man in Chriſt as he is a Vine that ſpreads himſelf into a viſible Church on Earth that may be cut off from him, and may be caſt out as a branch and wither; and yet if we look upon Chriſt as he is a head in Heaven, ſo he has no dead members; but as a Vine upon Earth, ſo he has many a withered branch, that may be cut off, and be caſt out, and men gather them, and <hi>they may be caſt into the fire and burn,</hi> that is, they burn hotter becauſe they prove more wicked than other men, and their priviledges do but adde to their ſins and quicken their deſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It's not meant of <hi>Legitimation,</hi> that is, a civil holineſs (as ſome will call it) as if the meaning were, <hi>elſe were your children baſtards; but now they are holy;</hi> that is, lawfully begotten: (1) Becauſe the Legitimation of the child does not depend upon the faith of the Parent either one, or both; for we know that there were lawfull marriages among the Heathen, and where the marriage is lawfull by the conſent of one man and one woman, there the ſeed is legitimate, though neither of them be a Believer; as on the other ſide, a child may be a Baſtard and illegitimate though both Parents be believers, if not begotten in lawful marriage, by the mutual conſent of both parties, giving up themſelves each to other in ſuch a relation; as we ſee it in the child of <hi>David</hi> begotten in Adultery, which was ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate, though both the Parents were Saints; for ſo we have good ground to conceive of <hi>Bathſheba;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 31.2.</note> 
                     <hi>Solomon the Son of my Vowes;</hi> now the holineſs here ſpoken of is ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon and flows from the faith of the Parents, one or both, and which onely faith can give, and nothing elſe. (2) The Holineſs that is here ſpoken of, is ſuch as may be loſt;<note place="margin">Rom. 11.20.</note> there is a holineſs that is derived from the root unto the branches, and the branches may be broken off, and others may be grafted in; now a man that is legitimate cannot be made illegitimate, and a man that is illegitimate, cannot be made legitimate; there is no way in the thing it ſelf to make him ſo, whatever may be done in the account and repute of men to civil ends. (3) It has been well obſerved by ſome of our Divines, that this doth wholly take away the ſtrength of the Apoſtles anſwer, and make it to be nothing to the purpoſe; for when once the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were converted, they did ſcruple in point of Conſcience whether they might lawfully live with their Pagan yoak-fellows, for fear of being corrupted by them: Now the Apoſtle anſwers this caſe thus, You may lawfully live with them, for ye are lawfully Man and Wife, your marriage is lawfull; if your Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage were not lawfull, your children were baſtards, but your Marriage is lawfull, and therefore your children are legitimate, which makes the Apoſtle ſpeak that which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it ſelf; for who did not well know, that the legitimation of the Child did flow from the lawfulneſs of the Marriage, and that if the Marriage be not lawful, the Child cannot be legitimate? This makes the Apoſtle ſpeak nothing to the purpoſe, or to the caſe that is propounded to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is yet another interpretation given of it by <hi>Eſtius,</hi> which alſo I find <hi>Jerome</hi> in one of his Epiſtles to <hi>Paulinus</hi> to give as the ſence that <hi>Tertullian</hi> did put upon theſe words, asking,<note place="margin">Fidelium filii dicuntur ſancti quia ſunt quaſi fidei candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dati.</note> 
                     <hi>How the Children of believing Parents are holy?</hi> He anſwers, Becauſe they are as it were in a way unto Faith and to Converſion, and brought under the power and bleſſing of a Chriſtian Education, and have the example of the Saints before their eyes, which may be powerful to Converſion; and ſo ſay they, Sanctification is ſuch a preparation, one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted and prepared for ſuch an end;<note place="margin">Iſa. 13.3.</note> the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> are called <hi>Gods ſanctified ones,</hi> that is, ſuch as he has ſet apart and prepared for ſuch a work; and ſo do theſe ſeem to be ſet apart by holy Education, and as it were prepared unto holineſs and converſion; and this is a ſence alſo that ſome do catch after, to avoid the true ſence of the holineſs that is here ſpoken of by the Apoſtle: But this cannot be the meaning here, (1) Becauſe the Apoſtle does not here ſpeak, as <hi>Chamier</hi> hath well obſerved, <hi>de re incerta &amp; futura, of a thing uncertain and future,</hi> but of ſomething which was already actually in being; not only they were in a way or preparation to holineſs, but they <hi>are</hi> holy, and the wife <hi>is</hi> ſanctified, as that which all the Believers in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> that were thus unequally yoak'd might build upon, though many of their Children ſhould never be converted by their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and religious Converſation. (2) This is a holineſs that is derived from the root to the branches, and doth come upon the Children through the faith of the Parents; but for Religious Education, that may as well befall the Child of a Pagan, he may be taken into a Chriſtian family, as men were bought by Chriſtians of old, and had religious education; and in this reſpect any Pagans Child taken into a godly family to be educated, may as truly be ſaid to be holy as the child of a Believer; ſo a <hi>Turks</hi> Child taken here to be edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, is as truly holy as the Child of any godly man in the world: but this cannot be,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:52030:124"/> for it is a holineſs that doth proceed from the faith of the parent, that if one of them be not a Believer, their children are unclean, and if they be, then they are holy; however they are educated afterwards, yet there is a holineſs that by grace comes upon them, and if the child of a Chriſtian ſhould be taken away by a Turk (as we have known many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have been, as <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) yet there is a holineſs comes upon the child from the faith of the parents, though he ſhould be deprived of holy and religious education, which good parents, if it had been in their power, would have given him.</p>

It would make this title to be a vain thing in the ſight of God, and all adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church grounded thereupon to no purpoſe; as if a Jew ſhould have taken the child of a Heathen and circumciſed it, it had not been an Ordinance of God, neither ſhould that child have been looked upon as circumciſed; as it's obſerved by <hi>Cyprian: De ratione circumciſionis.</hi>

Now there are but two ways that we read of in Scripture of bringing men into covenant, either by a <hi>perſonal right</hi> from the parties by converſion, or by <hi>parental right,</hi> which by the grace of the covenant is extended from the parents unto the children in a way of federal ſanctification.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This Doctrine of federal right by Sponſors lays three abſurdities inevitably, which I conceive thoſe very Divines cannot admit. (1) It puts the childs federal right upon his education, and a perſons undertaking for it to the Church, which the Scripture doth put upon a mans generation, making it a birth-priviledge; whatever his education be, that cannot take away the right of a child, till by his ſin through the Ordinance of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication he be as a branch broken off from the root upon which he did formerly grow. (2) It makes that which is an act of Gods free grace, to be mans free gift; no man is bound to adopt or to undertake the education of the child of another man; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is of free grace that God only takes parents into covenant with their children alſo; and to put this upon the act of man as an act of his grace, I cannot but look upon it as derogatory to the grace of God. (3) This will juſtifie that which generally our Divines condemn, namely the Papiſts ſtealing of the children of the Heathen to baptize them, there being ſome ſureties that will undertake to the Church for their education. It's true that it doth not juſtifie the theft, but yet as to the baptizing of them it doth, which our Divines generally and many of the Popiſh Divines themſelves condemn.</p>

And to decide this controverſie he writes to Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> and in anſwer to it he laid down two poſitions. (1) That it's unlawful for us to baptize the children of Papiſts: <hi>Abſurdum eſt ut eos baptizemus, qui corporis noſtri membra cenſeri nequeunt; &amp; cùm in hoc ordine ſint Papiſtarum liberi, quomodo baptiſmum illis adminiſtrare liceat non videmus, &amp;c.</hi> (2) The Grandmother deſires it, and there's the difficulty, upon that he anſwers, <hi>Cùm Dominus gratiam ſuam in multas aetates extendat, eam aſtringere non eſt noſtrum, &amp;c.</hi> Calv. Epiſt. pag. 174, 175. And it's the ordinary anſwer of our Divines, That the infant is not to be debarred from the priviledges of the Covenant for the ſins of the immediate parents; for thoſe that deſcended from <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David</hi> had a right to Circumciſion, and were within the Covenant, though the immediate parents for ſome fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going generations were wicked, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.35. they were mixed among the Heathen, and had learned their works, and ſerved their Idols, yet he regarded their affliction when he heard their cry, and remembred for them his Covenant,<note place="margin">verſ. 44.</note> even the Covenant that he made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The promiſe is to you and your children;</hi> and yet it's clear,<note place="margin">Acts 2.39.</note> that their immediate parents were a wicked generation, that had killed the Prophets, as they themſelves had a hand in crucifying the Lord of glory; concerning the Goſpel it's ſaid of the Jews, <hi>That they are enemies for your ſakes,</hi>

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:52030:127"/> but that ſome conſiderations have put me upon a further inquiry; for I find in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the ſeals of the Covenant as well as in the application of the promiſes of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that they are to be adminiſtred with judgment in the parties that do adminiſter them, and that there is a great truſt and a ſpecial charge committed to them therein, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. <hi>Give not that which is holy unto dogs;</hi> It's a dangerous evil for a man either wittingly or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to diſpenſe the Ordinances of God and the priviledges of the Covenant to thoſe unto whom God did never intend them, as it is to deny them unto thoſe whoſe right they are. As to apply the promiſes unto wicked men, and make glad the ſouls of the unrighteous, and to ſew a pillow under every arm-hole, and provide a kerchief for every head, is as bad as it is to deny the promiſes unto men whoſe right they are; ſo to make glad the ſouls of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by applying the ſeals to their ſeed, is as bad as to make ſad the ſouls of the righteous by denying them. It was that <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſtood much upon in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, he would rather ſuffer his own blood to be poured out, than to give the blood of Chriſt to be profaned by an unworthy receiver; and ſurely if ſo much care and diligence be to be uſed in Church-Officers in diſpenſing of one Sacrament, the other is not to be ſo careleſly and promiſcuouſly adminiſtred as it is; and therefore it was the great offence that Mr. <hi>Farell</hi> took at the Collegue joyned with him in the Miniſtry: <hi>Quòd omnia profanare &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probiſſimos velle admittere non-vereretur, That he feared not to profane all things, and admit the moſt wicked.</hi> Theſe thoughts have put me upon farther inquiry concerning the perſons unto whom the Sacrament of Baptiſm is to be adminiſtred, and to whom the priviledges of the Covenant do belong, and the apprehenſions that I have of it out of the word I ſhall deſire with all ſubmiſſion to propoſe to you. (1) I'le lay down in ſeveral propoſitions what. I conceive to be the truth. (2) I ſhall anſwer the objections that are commonly made againſt them; and ſo I hope the truth may be cleared, or at leaſt hereby an occaſion given to them that are better able to judge, of further inquiry.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Reaſons why fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral right comes to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from their immediate pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents only.</note>1. I conceive that federal right comes to the children only from the immediate pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; and the Reaſons that induce me to conceive ſo are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In Scripture I find that when God took parents into Covenant, he alſo took in their children with them, and whenſoever God caſt parents out, the immediate parents, he did caſt out their children alſo. When he took the Jews into Covenant, he made this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant alſo with their ſeed; and becauſe <hi>the root was holy,</hi> from thence came alſo an holineſs upon the branches: and when he did caſt off the immediate parents and called them <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ammi,</hi> he did alſo caſt off their ſeed; and it would have been in vain to the Jews to have ſaid, <hi>We have Abraham for our father,</hi> and therefore have ſtill a federal right, when God had given unto their immediate parents a bill of divorce, and looked upon them as a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Covenant with him no more: as therefore, though none of their predeceſſors were holy and in Covenant, yet the faith of the immediate parents and their intereſt in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant does make the children holy, and brings them under the priviledges of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; ſo though many of their predeceſſors were holy, yet if the immediate parents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and caſt off the Covenant, and be rejected of God, the children alſo are caſt out with them; there is the ſame reaſon of rejection by immediate parents, that there is of recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but the rejection may be in the one without reſpect unto Anceſtors, therefore it muſt be ſo in the reception alſo.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There are ſome Ordinances that are purely ſo, and may be diſpenſed to all that will partake in them; but there are ſome Ordinances that are ſuch as carry alſo priviledges with them, and belong not unto all men that will receive them, but in Scripture are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to ſome only; and amongſt theſe chiefly are the ſeals of the Covenant which are not to be adminiſtred to all men; for Chriſt did never appoint his Miniſters to baptize all mankind, but Believers only, and their ſeed whom he takes into Covenant with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I look upon Baptiſm as a great Ordinance: (1) As being one of the firſt Inſtitutions of the New Teſtament, and which the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf ſubjected unto by the hand of a ſervant. (2) In reſpect of the things ſignified and ſealed thereby, which are our firſt union with Chriſt, the great promiſe of the Spirit of Sanctification, our Redemption by Chriſt, and communion with him in his Death and Reſurrection. (3) It being the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of publick admiſſion into the viſible Church; for as under the Old Teſtament the admiſſion was by Circumciſion, ſo under the New it has always been by Baptiſm: <hi>They were baptized and added to the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It being an admiſſion into the viſible Church, it is a power committed unto men, unto whom the power of the Keys is committed; for as admiſſion into the Church inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is an immediate act of Chriſt, ſo admiſſion into the Church viſible is committed unto the Officers under Chriſt:<note place="margin">Mat. 16.19.</note> 
                     <hi>I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven:</hi> in Scripture a
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:52030:127"/> Key is <hi>ſymbolum poteſtatis, a ſymbol of power,</hi> as <hi>Eſa.</hi> 22.22. and this power is twofold. (1) <hi>Supreme and abſolute,</hi> which is in the hand of Chriſt, who is ſaid to have a double power, <hi>the Keys of Hell and Death,</hi> and <hi>the Key of the Church,</hi> called <hi>the Key of David;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 1.18. &amp; 3.7.</note> and this is by ſome called the <hi>Key of Royalty,</hi> he being the Head and King of the Church: but there is alſo (2) <hi>A power ſubordinate</hi> and <hi>limited, poteſtas oeconomi, the power of a ſteward,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> does expound it, <hi>a power of Miniſtry,</hi> by which all the affairs in his houſe as viſible may be acted and ordered according to his mind for the ends that he has propoſed; and this is <hi>a Key of Miniſtry,</hi> which ſome do call <hi>a Key of Charity;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eſa. 22.22. Rev. 3.7.</note> and theſe Keys are for opening and ſhutting the doors of the viſible Church; and therefore the perſons to whom they are committed, whether they be committed to the Church firſt, as <hi>the firſt ſubject,</hi> or <hi>to the Officers,</hi> we need not now diſpute; they both have an authority to open the Kingdom of Heaven unto ſome, and to ſhut it unto others.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Chriſt owns their acts no further than in them they walk by his rule and obſerve his order; as it is in Excommunications and Ejections, if they be <hi>clave errante,</hi> they do not bind in Heaven; as we ſee in the putting out of the Synagogue by the Phariſees, and by <hi>Diotrephes</hi> his uſurped power; as alſo by that of Antichriſt, who ordains,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.10. Rev. 13.17. <hi>Mede.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>That no man muſt buy or ſell ſave he that had the mark; anathematis Eccleſiaſtici cenſura innuitur.</hi> Now as ſuch <hi>Ejections</hi> are not owned by Chriſt, ſo neither are <hi>Admiſſions</hi> that are not according to the ſame rule; becauſe they are exerciſed <hi>errante clave,</hi> and therefore all that labour is in vain, and is a meer abuſe of the power of the Keys, and ſo a diſhonour put upon the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Chriſt in the one, as well as in the other, becauſe the rule is tranſgreſſed in both; for he has in his Word given rules for the one as well as for the other.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The truſt committed unto Officers in this kind is exceeding great, and therefore the account will be dreadful; for what is a particular viſible Church, but a <hi>golden Candleſtick,</hi> and the <hi>Sponſe of Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Body of Chriſt?</hi> Now how great a truſt is it to be imployed in things of ſo high concernment, and how dangerous muſt the errour needs be to eſpouſe a ſoul to Chriſt that he neither can nor will owne for his? How great a wrong is it? Now the nearer the relation, the greater the tranſgreſſion; and ſo it is to place a member in the body of Chriſt that he abhors: and therefore Admiſſions and Ejections of Church-members are ſome of the greateſt acts of mens lives, and ſhould be done with greateſt heed and the greateſt ſolemnity; and how ſhall that Officer appear before the Lord at the laſt day, who through ignorance knows not,<note place="margin">Judicatur mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no cum pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere, ut apud certos de Dei conſpectu ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum<expan>

                  <p n="6">6. There ought to be as great care in one Sacrament, that it be not miſapplied, as there is in the other.

                  <p n="1">1. Whereſoever God has taken parents into Covenant, he has taken their children al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; and when he has caſt out the immediate parents, he has caſt out their children with them, as before.</p>

I confeſs that mans judgment is not to be the rule, but the application of the rule is to be by him as well in one Sacrament (I conceive) as in another; as he that ſhall ſay he does not conceive ſuch a man fit to receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and ſuch a man he does, this does not make his judgment the rule, but leaves unto him the application of the rule in reference to the truſt committed unto him; and this will make all to go upon doubtful and uncertain grounds all their days, that a man knows no holineſs by his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate parents, and yet he can ſuppoſe ſome of his remote parents were holy; and by this means he knows not how to adminiſter it upon the known unholineſs of his immediate pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and yet he knows not how to withhold it from the ſuppoſed holineſs of the remote parents; and this has brought in, I ſay, the promiſcuous baptizing of all amongſt us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction.</p>

(2) If it ſhould be underſtood of Church-priviledges and a federal holineſs that deſcends upon the child from the parents, then how ſhall this promiſe and threatning be both made good? for it may be ſome of the Anceſtors have been godly, but the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate parents are wicked and profane, why may we not as well and much rather ſay, that God will viſit the iniquity of the immediate parents upon the children, as that he will ſhew mercy unto the children for the grace and holineſs of their remote parents? (3) Of what mercy ſoever it's thus underſtood, whether of ſaving mercies, or of outward bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, it's plain, that it's only unto thoſe children which walk in the ſame ways of holineſs with their parents; for God will viſit the iniquity of the parents upon the children, and if his hatred to children to the third and fourth generation be of them that walk in the ways and wickedneſs of the fathers, then his mercy to thouſands is upon them that walk in the ways of their fathers obedience.

But in the Chriſtians Baptiſm it's not ſo, there is a ſet Officer, who is to adminiſter it with judgment, and as he is to deny it to none to whom it belongs, ſo he is to diſpenſe it to none, but ſuch to whom it belongs. (2) The Lord took the whole Nation of the Jews into a Church-covenant, and they became a <hi>peculiar people</hi> unto him, and whoever was born of that Nation, was therefore born a Church-member, and had right unto the priviledges of the Church; it is not ſo with any other people under Heaven, there is ſomething more required to make a man a Church-member than barely to be born of ſuch a Nation; and therefore while they continued Church-members, though they were never ſo profane and wicked, this could not prejudice the priviledge of the Church. And though ſuch deſerve to be caſt out, yet as long as the Church doth through negligence or connivence continue ſuch in a ſtate of member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, they cannot deny them the priviledge of members; but yet it doth appear, that now under the Goſpel many men that live in the Church are not true members of the Church; or if they be caſt out, then they and their children are juſtly deprived of the priviledges of members, becauſe it doth not belong unto them; and though the poſterity of <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> did uſe Circumciſion after they were ſeparated from the Church of God, yet it was unto them only a vain and an empty ſign, and no Church-ordinance, neither was it unto them a Church-priviledge any longer than they continued Church-members. (3) This ſeems to be demonſtrative, that none are to be looked upon as within the Covenant, and to have right unto the ſeals but Church-members, and that the Church-memberſhip of children is a priviledge that they receive from their immediate parents only, and that it's
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:52030:129"/> not barely a parents being baptized, and making a profeſſion of Chriſt, that doth <hi>de jure</hi> give him a right to memberſhip; and therefore if parents profeſs Chriſt, and yet are not to be looked upon as members of the Church, then <hi>Calvins</hi> rule I think will hold, <hi>He that is not a Church-member himſelf cannot convey a right of memberſhip unto his children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here are three things to be proved.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That none have a right to the ſeals of the Covenant, but thoſe that are members of the Church.</hi> This <hi>Calvin</hi> in an Epiſtle to Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> clearly aſſerts: <hi>Semper attentè cavendum eſt, ne profanetur hujus myſterii ſanctitas, quod fieri certum eſt, ſi promiſcuè alicui conceditur, vel quiſpiam recipitur, qui inter legitimos Eccleſiae cives numerari nequeat.</hi> Therefore they that are baptized muſt be <hi>Cives Eccleſiae, thoſe that have a title to memberſhip;</hi> for the Ordinance of Baptiſme is profaned, if it be applied unto any other, and the clear grounds of it are theſe. The ſcals are the priviledges of Church-members only, and if they be adminiſtred unto any whoſe priviledge they are not, they are certainly profaned; for Chriſt admitted none but Diſciples,<note place="margin">Act. 2.</note> and his Diſciples afterward admitted none but Diſciples: <hi>They that believed were of one heart, and they continued in breaking of bread, and prayer,</hi> &amp;c. and afterwards when the Church grew more corrupt and more remiſs, that ſuch were admitted who did manifeſt they had no right unto this priviledge, they were looked upon as <hi>ſpots in their feaſts,</hi> and it was judged a diſhonour unto that Church. And for this cauſe in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, though the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> were admitted to <hi>hear,</hi> and were called <hi>Audientes</hi> and <hi>Orantes,</hi> yet thoſe that they did excommunicate they did allow thoſe Ordinances to, and therefore they did uſe to ſentence them, <hi>Orent per triennium inter Catechumenos,</hi> or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more years, according to the nature of the fact; but yet they ſtill did deprive them of the ſeals, as being a priviledge of members only. (2) Baptiſm is a Sacrament of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, and the Ordinance of viſible admiſſion into the Church; and that muſt not be done promiſcuouſly, and without diſcrimination; for, as it's a ſin to keep out thoſe whoſe right it is, ſo it's a ſin alſo to admit them that have no right, becauſe thereby the Ordinances of Chriſt are abuſed and miſplaced where he never intended them, and for whom he never inſtituted them. Now a perſon muſt have a right to memberſhip before ever he is to be admitted a member, and he has no right to claim admiſſion of thoſe who have the power of the Keys, unleſs it be upon this ground, that a right of memberſhip does belong unto him; and therefore he does upon this deſire admiſſion as a member, that ſo he be not defrauded of his right. And <hi>Calvin</hi> profeſſes in another Epiſtle, <hi>Niſi inter vos vigeat diſcrimen aliquod, ut prohibeantur, qui ſine craſſa Dei injuria admitti nequeunt, pro confeſſo ſumo, tam baptiſmum, quam coenam profanari.</hi> To whom is this ſpoken? It was not to Jews and Turks, and the admiſſion of Heathens, but unto Chriſtians and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; and yet he ſays, that there muſt be among them <hi>diſcriminatio quaedam, a certain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination;</hi> though they were Chriſtians in profeſſion, yet that did not give them all a title, if it had, there needed no difference to be put: and obſerve, he will have this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to be put in reference to the Sacrament of Baptiſm, as well as the Supper of the Lord; and he complaineth of this diſorder of adminiſtring the Sacrament promiſcuouſly, and exhorteth the Miniſters to endeavour the reforming it; if they could not ſay how it was lawful for them to hold their places, <hi>certè ubi rogando &amp; hortando nihil proficitur, ac fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra etiam conqueſti ſumus, nos religione conſtringi, ne pergamus ſcientes &amp; volentes ſacra Dei myſteria profanare; in tam confuſa ordinis perturbatione quomodo ſtare nobis liceat, neſcio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Right of memberſhip conveyed unto children from the immediate parents is a truth that the whole Scripture ſeems to hold forth. [1] When-ever the immediate parents were taken into Covenant, whatever their Anceſtors have been, their poſterity were taken into Covenant alſo, and had a right to memberſhip together with their parents; <hi>Abrahams</hi> father was <hi>Terah, And he with his father ſerved other gods beyond the river, Joſh.</hi> 24.2. and yet as ſoon as the Lord took <hi>Abraham</hi> into Covenant, he took in his poſterity alſo with him immediately; and therefore the children of thoſe that are Church-members are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>children of the Covenant,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 3.25.</note> ſo as their intereſt in the Covenant comes upon them as their birth-right. For it is true, that there are but two ways of conveying a Covenant-right unto men, either <hi>perſonal</hi> by their own faith, or <hi>parental;</hi> and this is not of nature, for by nature one mans child has as much right as anothers, none are born Chriſtians, but it's a gift of grace, and which doth follow upon the child by virtue of the parents Covenant; and though none of his Anceſtors were Believers, but ſerved other gods, yet the immediate parents being Believers can give a right without reſpect unto the condition of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors: and ſo it was with the Proſelytes among the Jews, their children were taken into Covenant with their immediate parents, though their Anceſtors were for many genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wicked. Many inſtances of this have been given before. [2] Children taken into Covenant have with their immediate parents been caſt out; <hi>Iſmael</hi> was taken into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:52030:129"/> and received the ſeal of the Covenant; but when he was caſt out, though <hi>Abraham</hi> was alive, yet <hi>Iſmaels</hi> family was never after looked upon as in Covenant, or as members of the viſible Church of God: ſo it was with <hi>Eſau</hi> and his poſterity the <hi>Edomites,</hi> their father being put out of Covenant, though they did attain Circumciſion, which was a ſeal of the Covenant, yet it was not Circumciſion in Gods account; for they were never by God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a Church unto him. But that's a remarkable inſtance amongſt the Jews, when the Church of God had continued in that Nation for many generations, and though God had there a greater income of holineſs once, than he had in all the world beſide, and was not aſhamed to be called their God, and to call them of all the nations of the earth his <hi>peculiar people;</hi> yet when the Lord caſt off their immediate parents, and gave them a bill of divorce, he did alſo caſt off their children, who can never claim a right from their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors; neither would any man by this claim (I conceive) admit a Jew unto the ſeals of the Covenant. And yet after this long interruption, <hi>wherein wrath is come upon them to the uttermoſt;</hi> when the immediate parents ſhall be converted, and taken into Covenant with God again, then alſo ſhall their children be gathered in together with them; and this, as far as I underſtand, is the whole tenour of the Scripture, and I know no inſtance that children were taken into Covenant, whatever their Anceſtors were, unleſs their immediate parents were Church-members.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The right of memberſhip does not conſiſt barely in being baptized, and making a profeſſion of the name of Chriſt; and therefore parents may have both theſe, and yet not be judged Church-members. (1) Being baptized doth not give a man a right unto Church-memberſhip, and the grounds of it are theſe. [1] That which is the ſeal of our admiſſion into the viſible Church, cannot give a man a right to it, ſo as to make a man a member; that is, if a man ought to have the right of memberſhip before he be baptized, then his Baptiſm does not give him this right, but ſeal it only, and gives a viſible confirmation thereunto; but Baptiſm is a ſeal of a mans admiſſion; therefore it's not Baptiſm that gives him a right of admiſſion, but the promiſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. <hi>For the promiſe is to you and your children,</hi> therefore ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Be baptized;</hi> therefore it's ſomething before Baptiſm that gives a right of memberſhip, by virtue of which a man lays claim to Baptiſm; for the ſeals belong to Church-members only. [2] If Baptiſm make a man a member of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, then while the Baptiſm remains firm, the memberſhip remains; for <hi>forma dat eſſe rei;</hi> but we ſee that is not ſo in a double caſe, 1. In the caſe of wilful Apoſtaſie, when men withdraw themſelves from the Church, <hi>They went out from us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.19.</note> 
                     <hi>becauſe they were not of us;</hi> theſe were baptized, and their Baptiſm did remain, and yet they did wilfully ſeparate from the Church of God; wherefore according to this opinion they are to be looked upon ſtill as Church members; becauſe Baptiſm which gave them a right does remain, and there is nothing can take away their right but that which does null their Baptiſm and makes it void. 2. In the caſe of Excommunication; as the former does caſt off the Church, ſo is the latter caſt off by the Church; and as the one renounceth fellowſhip with the Church, ſo does the Church renounce fellowſhip with this man. Now if there be a power of the Keys, as 'tis commonly granted, then as there is a power of admiſſion, ſo there is alſo a power of ejection; and therefore Chriſt ſays of ſuch a man, <hi>You are to account him a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and a Publican,</hi> that is, no Church-member; and yet this mans Baptiſm remains, and the man may be truly godly, and a member of the Church inviſible, as the inceſtuous <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> was, and yet juſtly caſt out of the Church viſible, and to be looked upon, according to the rules of Chriſt, as one that had no right unto viſible memberſhip, nor to be reckoned among that number. [3] This will evidence the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be a true Church, and the Papiſts among us to be true members; for all the members of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have received true Baptiſm, and therefore they are members of the true Church; and yet we know that the Scripture calls <hi>Rome, Babylon the great, the mother of Harlots,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 11.</note> and that ſhe is ſpiritually <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Sodom;</hi> the Lord has given her a bill of divorce; and our Divines generally will not acknowledge <hi>Rome</hi> to be a true Church, and therefore the members thereof not to be true members; and yet it is as generally acknowledged, that their Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm is true Baptiſm, therefore 'tis not Baptiſm that gives a man a right unto Church-memberſhip. (2) It's not an outward profeſſion in a Chriſtian Church that gives a man a right of memberſhip: now by a profeſſion I mean an aſſent unto the Doctrine of Faith and life, as it is in the Word of God delivered unto us, as it ſtands in oppoſition unto practice, and ſo we uſually oppoſe it; for if profeſſion and practice go together, as far as man can judge, then there is ſomething to judge of ſuch a mans memberſhip by beſides pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion only; but profeſſion only will not ſuffice, [1] Becauſe the members of a viſible Church muſt be viſible Saints; for the matter of the Church viſible and inviſible is the ſame, that is, Saints only; the one are Saints in Gods account, who diſcerns them by the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:52030:130"/> judgment of certainty and infallibility, becauſe it's God that admits into the Church invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; and the other are Saints in the account of thoſe to whom the power of the Keys is committed, who judge only by the judgment of charity; and therefore what there is in the one in truth, muſt be in the other in ſhew and appearance, for it muſt be a judicious, and not a blind charity.<note place="margin">Calv. Inſtit. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>108.</hi> Apoll. de qualif. membrorum.</note> Now our Divines generally ſay, that there are three things that do concur to make a man a viſible Saint. (1) They muſt be men inſtructed in the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion, and able in ſome meaſure to give an account of the reaſon of the hope that is in them. (2) They muſt yield a willing ſubjection to the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13. and they that gladly receive the word, as <hi>Act.</hi> 2. (3) They muſt walk unblameably in their converſation; but the fooliſh Virgins as well as the wiſe had oyl in their lamps, and made a ſhew, a profeſſion before men, and did ſeem to ſhine as lights in the world, and yet their hearts were not upright and ſound with God. It's true, that ſome there are that grow higher in the qualification of members, but we will content our ſelves with theſe in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the thing in hand; and if a viſible Saintſhip doth make a man a member, and that viſible Saint muſt be in this manner qualified, then it's not barely profeſſion will do it; but many a man amongſt us holds forth the profeſſion of Chriſt, who is ignorant even in the Principles of Religion, and knows little more of the Religion that he profeſſes, than if he were a meer Pagan, yea is ſo far from ſubjection unto the duties of Holineſs, that he is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed enemy and ſcorner of them, and whoſe life is full of nothing elſe but profaneneſs and the moſt profligate wickedneſs. Now I cannot conceive, that a mans profeſſion of the name of Chriſt, and calling himſelf a Chriſtian, can give him a right of memberſhip, becauſe it cannot conſtitute him a viſible Saint, which is acknowledged by all to be the matter of a viſible Church. [2] It will appear that profeſſion will not do it, by this, becauſe perſons who are Church-members may ſcandalouſly fall, as the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian</hi> did, and may by the ſcandal of their fall juſtly deſerve Excommunication, and thereby be cut off from the Church, and yet the mans profeſſion ſtill remain. And being caſt out, profeſſion is not enough to reſtore a man to the right of memberſhip; for there muſt be a humiliation and an anſwerable converſation upon tryal, proving that humiliation to be true, or elſe all the profeſſion in the world will never be a ground unto them that have the power of the Keys to reſtore ſuch a man, as in the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian</hi> it doth appear: neither was meer profeſſion a ground of admiſſion in the primitive times; and therefore, though men had embraced the Chriſtian Faith, and made a profeſſion of it, yet they were not admitted Church-members, till they were baptized; and they were <hi>Catechumeni</hi> ſome of them a great while, to be inſtructed in the Principles of Religion, and that an exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count might be taken of their converſation, before they were baptized. Now if this be true, that the childrens right of memberſhip is from parents that are members, and that none are members but viſible Saints, and viſible Saints are ſuch only as are inſtructed in the Principles of Religion, and profeſs to ſubject themſelves to the Ordinances of Chriſt, and walk outwardly anſwerably thereunto; then ſurely many of them who are counted Church-members, really are not ſo, and if in their viſible ſtanding they be yet ſo, becauſe not caſt out, yet <hi>de jure</hi> they ought not to be ſo reputed, for they ought to be caſt out. <hi>Calvin</hi> confeſſeth,<note place="margin">Calv. epiſt. pag. <hi>438.</hi>

(1) This does make way for the Baptizing of all promiſcuouſly that live amongſt us; for if we acknowledge, that by their immediate Parents they have no right, yet in the judgement of Charity it's ſaid, that we are to conceive, that ſome of their Anceſtors were Believers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may upon this judgment baptize them, which Divines do commonly ſay, is a

(2) By this means they that are Officers are put to act upon great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties, as having no Rule to admit by; for there is certainly a time when the fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Right of Anceſtors will ceaſe, it doth not laſt in all ſucceeding Generations; and how ſhall a man be able to judge of this? Now I conceive we had need be as careful in Admiſſions as in Ejections, and have as ſure a Rule, and as clear for the one as for the other, if we look upon it as an Ordinance, and an Inſtitution of Chriſt. And truly were we as careful of Admiſſions as we ought to be, we ſhould have leſs need of Ejections than now we have. (3) By this means we put a great deal of difference between the Seals of the ſame Covenant, as if one were far more honourable than the other; therefore we muſt have ſuch Rules to ſatisfie us for admiſſion to the one, but we may goe upon any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, which we will call the Judgment of Charity, for the other. (4) By this means ungodly men are nouriſhed in an evil way, and are born up with a good conceit of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, of their eſtates, that they are in as good a condition as any, and their Children have as good a right unto all Church-priviledges as any other men, though they be never ſo wicked and prophane, nay though they deſerve to be caſt out; and by this means mens hearts are ſtrangely hardened in a way of ſinning; for they ſay, <hi>all the Lords people are holy, every one of them, Color omnibus unus;</hi> and therefore the world have ever been great enemies to all differencing wayes whatſoever; becauſe all muſt goe under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon notion of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> though it be <hi>in opprobrium Chriſti.</hi> (5) I find that in the ancient Church there was a great deal of care and exactneſs this way, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him who was admitted unto Baptiſm, as well as to the Supper of the Lord; and ſo great was the ſtrictneſs, that <hi>Calvin</hi> ſayes, <hi>Nimia fuit auſteritas in veteribus, non permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere indignos, qui arceri legitimo judicio nequeunt;</hi> ſpeaking unto this very caſe, thinking it unlawfull to deprive ſuch of what he did conceive to be their right: but yet ſuch was the ſtrictneſs and exactneſs of the Ancients in this Ordinance, and the adminiſtration of it, that he looks upon it as too great ſeverity.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. There is a great deal of difference in the conſtitution of the Jewiſh Church, and of the Churches under the Goſpel; theirs was National; which is plain, becauſe they are National Officers, and National Ordinances, and a ſet place for the Church-meeting of the whole Nation, to which by the command of God the Nation was to repair three times a year; and therefore all that were of that Nation were to be admitted Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and to receive the Seal of admiſſion, and no man might live among them if they were uncircumciſed. <hi>Non poterant Hebraei habere domi ſervos incircumciſos, The Hebrews might not have ſervants uncircumciſed;</hi> but if they were ſuch as would not ſubject themſelves unto the Ordinance of Admiſſion, which was Circumciſion, either they ought not to buy them, or they might not lawfully retain them: but it is not thus with the Gentile-Churches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Teſtament, the Lord doth not take in Nations into Covenant with him, but he takes them in man by man; and therefore even in the ſame Nation, ſome may be within, and ſome without; neither is there any neceſſity, that all that are born in the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:52030:131"/> Nation ſhould therefore be members of the Churches of God in that Nation; hence the Lord when he did caſt them off, did caſt off the whole Nation, and the ejection was not of particular perſons,<note place="margin">Iſa. 66.8.</note> and God will convert the Nation again, and they ſhall have national Ordinances and a national Covenant, and therein they are diſtinguiſhed from all other Churches, and ſhall be; but ſeeing our taking in is perſonal, and our ejection perſonal, it's not ſo with us, but the father may be taken in with the children, and the father caſt out with the children, and yet the Covenant be continued to the reſt of the people, and the Churches of Chriſt amongſt them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Jews continued in a Church-ſtate though they were prophane, till the Nation was caſt off, and cut off from being a Church unto God; now the queſtion is not, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an ungodly man living in the Church, while he keeps his viſible ſtanding there, and is not caſt out, may not claim a viſible right unto all the Ordinances, for himſelf and his Poſterity, for certainly, while he keeps his viſible ſtanding, though he be a wicked-man, yet it cannot be deny'd him; and ſo it was amongſt the Jews: But if any amongſt us, through the negligence of the Church, be continued in our Churches ſo profane, and we do not bear them as burdens, and caſt them off, as judging <hi>that a little leven will leven the whole lump;</hi> it is the ſin of the Church, that ſuch men ſhould have a viſible ſtanding, therefore they ought to be caſt out; and ſo <hi>de jure</hi> they have no right, and if they be once caſt out and excommunicated, then they that are judged themſelves to have no right unto Church-Ordinances, cannot give this right unto others. And it is that which we muſt look upon as the great ſin of this Nation, that we will intitle the whole Nation to a Church-ſtate, and every particular perſon a Church-member; and yet no care is taken that either they walk as does become Members, or elſe that they be excluded from ſuch a pretended right; and the Reformation of this Nation will never be thorough, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of the Goſpel, till this be done in all Priviledges, Ordinances, one as well as another.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſay, <hi>it is not Grace regenerating and ſanctifying, that gives a title either to the Parent or to his ſeed;</hi> and that I ſhall prove by theſe particulars:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If men that have no Grace, that were never regenerated, never new-born to God, may have a Covenant-title; then that which gives a man a title is not Grace; but a man that has no Grace, that was never born from above, may have a true title; therefore, it's not their Grace that gives them this title. Here conſider, (1) That the Church of God is either <hi>Inviſible,</hi> or <hi>Viſible;</hi> the Inviſible Church is the Church of the <hi>firſt-born,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12.23.</note> 
                     <hi>whoſe names are written in Heaven,</hi> and conſiſts only of regenerate, and Believers in truth; this is the <hi>body of Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Spouſe of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>the fulneſs of him that filleth all in all:</hi> But as for the <hi>Viſible</hi> Church, it is made up of viſible Saints, and it does enjoy viſible Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as we ſee in the Church of the Jews, and in all the converted Churches of the Gentiles, they did all imbody for the publick Worſhip of God. (2) This viſible Church has viſible Members, and viſible Priviledges; as the Church inviſible has inviſible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and inviſible Priviledges: Indeed it is unto theſe that all the ſpiritual Promiſes of the Covenant do belong, and all the ſaving Graces of the Covenant are conferr'd; but yet there are many viſible Priviledges of the viſible Church, which none but the viſible members, according to the Rules of the Word, are to partake of; we have theſe ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up in eight particulars, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4, 5, 6. Theſe are the viſible Priviledges of the viſible Church. (3) Unto theſe a man that has no ſaving Grace may have a right, according to the Rules of the Word; and being looked upon by the Word as a viſible member of a Church, he has by the ſame Rule a right to the viſible Priviledges which belong unto a Church-member. A man may be a true member of the viſible Church without Grace; for the Net gathers of every kind, ſome good, and ſome bad;<note place="margin">Matth. 13.47.</note> and into this Society many are called that are not choſen; there be fooliſh as well as wiſe Builders, and Virgins; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, as well as clean Beaſts; branches in Chriſt, as he ſpreads himſelf upon Earth into a viſible Church, that bear no fruit, and yet are truly ſaid to be members, and grow as members of the Church; and therefore the Jews are ſaid <hi>to be broken off,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 9.26.</note> they were once owned by God as a peculiar people, and as a holy Nation unto him; but now he will be no more ſtyled their God: and as men may have a viſible ſtanding in the Church, and a viſible right of memberſhip, without Grace, ſo a man may partake in and have a right to the viſible priviledges of a member, though he have no Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17. <hi>Thou being a wild Olive Tree, waſt grafted in amongſt them;</hi> and to what end were they
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:52030:132" rendition="simple:additions"/> ingrafted? it was, that they might with them partake of the root and fatneſs of the Olive-tree; this root and fatneſs cannot be meant of ſaving grace; for if they had partaken of them,<note place="margin">Pareus.</note> they had never been broken off, therefore it's meant of outward priviledges only; therefore the Gentiles have their priviledges into which they are ingrafted, that is, inſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as well as the Jews had, and yet it's not ſaving grace in them that entitles them unto this priviledge, becauſe he ſays, <hi>Let them alſo take heed for all this, leſt they alſo be broken off,</hi> as the Jews the natural branches were.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Theſe external priviledges are ſuch as belong to the viſible Church, into which men muſt admit, and they cannot judge of the truth of grace and regeneration by an infallible judgment, and therefore there muſt be ſome viſible ſigns which, as rules, they are to act by in things of ſo high a nature. As the Church is diſtinguiſhed into viſible and inviſible, ſo there is a double power of the Keys anſwerable. (1) The Lord Chriſt has a <hi>Key of Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,</hi>

(2) There is a Key of charity, as ſome call it, though improperly, yet true in this reſpect, becauſe it's only the <hi>judgment of charity,</hi> that they can proceed by, and not of <hi>infallibility;</hi> and this is an act belonging properly to Church-officers,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.19.</note> by virtue of an inſtitution of Chriſt unto that end, and they that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in this work cannot judge infallibly of the truth of grace in any they admit. Though it's true, that the tree is much known by the fruit, yet we find that <hi>Peter</hi> did baptize <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and the Church admitted <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> and thoſe mentioned in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. they were admitted amongſt them, though afterwards they appeared not to be of them; and that which was ſaid of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is true ſtill of the viſible Church, <hi>They are not all Iſrael that are of Iſrael.</hi> The Church inviſible has no Officer but Chriſt alone, and he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits by a judgment of infallibility; but the viſible Church has viſible Officers, who are to proceed by a known rule, and Baptiſm being the ordinance of admiſſion, is by them to be adminiſtred to perſons as viſible, and not as inviſible members of the Church; all theſe therefore that are to be admitted by them, muſt be admitted by a known rule, which they can judge of, which is not truth of grace, for that they cannot know, it belongs to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt only, who knows both the counſels of God, and the hearts of men; and therefore they muſt admit ſuch as in appearance and in the judgment of charity are ſo, though it may be in truth and verity afterwards they prove not ſo to be.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Excommunication breaks a man off from the viſible Church and the viſible privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges thereof, but it cannot cut a man off from the Church inviſible and the truth of grace in the heart, which the Lord has promiſed to continue to the end; for into what a man is admitted by the Keys, out of that by the Keys he may be ejected; but no man is admitted for grace, neither can he be ejected for want of grace, if viſibly a member, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15. <hi>Let him be unto thee as a Publican:</hi> it's not ſpoken of one without, but of one within, for it's an offending brother; and he ſays, he ſhould be put into the ſame condition with a <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Publican.</hi> Amongſt the Jews they did not hold communion with Heathens and Publicans; Heathens were not admitted into Ordinances as Church-members, till they became circumciſed Proſelytes; ſo that the meaning is, count them unworthy to be admitted to publick Ordinances and the publick priviledges of the Church, which other Church-members may challenge a right unto, and they themſelves had a right before their ſcandal and ejection: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Deliver ſuch a man unto Satan,</hi> which I conceive cannot be meant of any miraculous work, becauſe the Apoſtle commits it to the Church to do it in the Name of God, and by virtue of the authority committed to them in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and therefore I conceive it to be nothing elſe but caſting a man out of the ſociety of the Church, and leaving him amongſt the ſociety of ungodly men, over whom Satan rules; and being put out of the Kingdom of Chriſt, which is the Church, and the care of the Church, he is truly delivered to Satan to carry him whither he will, as ungodly men are called by the Father <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, &amp;c. and yet the inceſtuous <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> was a godly man, and he was not caſt out from the promiſes of grace and the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Spirit, but from the external priviledges of the Church; and ſo may a godly man for ſcandalous falls juſtly be, and yet his grace continue an immortal ſeed, and he remain a member of the inviſible Church ſtill, even when he is caſt out of the viſible Church; as <hi>Job</hi> and many of the Saints were members of the inviſible Church, and yet had not opportunity to joyn themſelves unto any viſible Church any further than their own family were ſuch. The Church then can caſt a man out of what he was by them admitted to; but that was not grace, but outward priviledges, and they can only caſt men out of theſe. It is not grace gives a man a right to external admiſſion; for then a man that had grace, what offence ſoever he committed, could not be ejected; but a man that
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:52030:132"/> has true grace may, for a ſcandalous offence, be according to the rules of the word, lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ejected, therefore it was not his grace that gave him his admiſſion; neither is it grace that in his ejection he can be deprived of; that being an act of God, but they can only hinder him from viſible communion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A viſible profeſſion will give unto a man <hi>in foro Eccleſiae,</hi> a right of memberſhip. (1) Men can go upon no other ground; for if the matter of a Church muſt be Saints, they can judge no further of Saintſhip than by the viſibility of it; and becauſe they cannot have <hi>certitudinem fidei; ergo Deus judicium charitatis eis ſubſtituit;</hi> for the Key of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry committed unto Officers doth but open and ſhut in reference unto the external privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and benefits of the Church, into which a viſible profeſſion will give unto a man a viſible right, and is proper and proportionable thereunto. (2) Upon this ground admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions have always been: it was ſo that the Jews admitted Proſelytes; called <hi>Proſelytae foede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> upon their profeſſion of the Jewiſh Religion, and a ſubjection unto the Ordinances of God there; and yet many of them were the children of Hell after they were made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes, as Chriſt himſelf tells us; and ſo <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> admitted unto Baptiſm, they were baptized of him after they had confeſſed their ſins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Peter, Simon Magus,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> the Eunuch on his confeſſion of the Faith; and we read, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13. of a profeſſed ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Goſpel, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it's in the Original a <hi>ſubjection,</hi> or <hi>confeſſion of the Goſpel;</hi> and all their after-obedience is but a manifeſtation of the truth of that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of theirs: and therefore I conclude, that it's but outward profeſſion will give a man a right in the external court of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Yet I conceive it's not a bare profeſſion, how unanſwerable ſoever a mans converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be, that will bring in a man being without, or being within keep him from being caſt out; and this will appear in theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) The Lord in his Word requires that they ſhould be viſible Saints, which we heard before a bare profeſſion would not entitle them unto; therefore <hi>Eſa.</hi> 54.12. <hi>He will lay their foundations with precious ſtones,</hi> &amp;c. it's not to be interpreted <hi>de doctrina, of doctrine,</hi>

                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.2. <hi>The court which is without the temple, leave out,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore it concerns all Churches to look that they become an outward court, in alluſion to the <hi>Atrium Gentium, the Court of the Gentiles</hi> among the Jews; for it was that which ſet up Antichriſt, and gave him in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that power that he has exerciſed over them. And it was a great tryal (how lightly ſoever we conceive of it) that the Apoſtles had of all they did admit: for if we ſuppoſe they did only require of them a confeſſion that Chriſt was the Son of God, and that upon this they were added to the Church; yet if we conſider that this was the great truth then oppoſed and perſecuted, the great controverſie of the age, and that which betrayed them to perſecution immediately;<note place="margin">Joh. 9.</note> for whoever did confeſs him was to be put out of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue; and this made many men to keep off from embracing of the Goſpel; wherefore it was then a great mark of ſincerity for a man to embrace a perſecuted Truth in times of Perſecution; and to endure a great fight of afflictions, and yet receive the Word in much affliction, with joy in the Holy Ghoſt, it was a very great ground for a mans judicious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to reſt on. As it were now a ſmall matter for a man to preach againſt <hi>Tranſubſtantiation, the real preſence of Chriſt</hi> in the Sacrament; yet for a man to bear witneſs againſt that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and to maintain the truth in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days, when all the power of the Kingdom was againſt it, and when ſo many were ſent to Heaven in a fiery Chariot for the ſame, that had been a great ground for judicious charity to have reſted upon for the ſincerity of the man; and therefore it's ſaid, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6, 7. <hi>He that hath begun the good work in you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it;</hi> it is but an equal and juſt thing for me to think ſo of you all; they were all ſuch of whom he might have ſome ground in charity to hope and judge, that they had a good work begun in them, which ſhould be perfected in the day of the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) The matter of the viſible Church muſt be ſuitable to the ends for which the Lord has inſtituted ſuch Churches: for every wiſe man does chuſe materials ſuitable to the work in which he intends to uſe them; as in the Tabernacle there was gold and ſilver, and there was purple and blue, each anſwerable to the end in which it was to be uſed: now there is a double end why the Lord has inſtituted viſible Churches. [1] That they may be a <hi>pillar
<pb facs="tcp:52030:133" rendition="simple:additions"/> of truth</hi> to hold forth his word and to hold up his worſhip, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. [2] That they may be a people amongſt whom the Lord may dwell; and therefore the Church is called <hi>the Houſe of God;</hi> and he will dwell in them, and walk amongſt them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>The tabernacle of the Lord is with men, Rev.</hi> 21. the name of the city is <hi>Jehovah ſhammah, the Lord is there.</hi> Now if men profeſs, and yet be ignorant, they cannot hold forth the truth, and if they be profane, they will never hold up the worſhip of God, and if they are wicked, the Lord will depart from them, and will not dwell among them.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) It will appear alſo from the nature of the Ordinance of Excommunication; which is to paſs upon none but thoſe <hi>within,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 3.6.</note> if <hi>a brother,</hi> &amp;c. and it was the honour of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that they looked upon them that were evil, as burdens, and <hi>could not bear them.</hi> Now if a profeſſion with a ſcandalous converſation will not keep a man in, when he is in, ſurely it is no good ground to let a man in when he is without; if ſuch ought to be ſeparated from the Church being admitted, ſurely if they be without they are not to be admitted; and I do think it ſtrange, that men ſhould ſpeak of it as a great ſin that profane perſons in the Church ſhould be tolerated, and yet ſhould plead for a promiſcuous admiſſion upon a bare profeſſion only, though their whole converſation ſpeak the contrary. Truly unleſs we make Churches and Church-members to be only notions and empty things, we ought, I conceive, to make conſcience of our admiſſions as well as ejections: and ſurely if that were done, there would be leſs need of Excommunications, and yet a greater purity in our Churches preſerved, and be for ought I know the beſt bottom of our reformation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I muſt here repeat what has been already delivered, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is the immediate parents only that give federal right to their children. 1. Some conſiderations were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, namely that admiſſion of members is an act of the Keys, and the great truſt the Lord has committed unto them, and therefore they are to proceed by rule therein. And that to adminiſter Sacraments is not an act of Chriſtian liberty, that a Miniſter may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe to whom he will, but an act of power, which Chriſt has given to them that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Miniſtry of the Word; and they are to diſpenſe them to none but unto thoſe whoſe priviledges they are; and that as great care is to be taken in the adminiſtration of one Sacrament, that it be not done promiſcuouſly, as of the other. Whence we proceed to prove our poſition: (1) I find in Scripture, that when the immediate parents were taken into covenant, the children were taken in with them, how wicked ſoever their Anceſtors were, as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s, &amp;c. and when the immediate parents were caſt out, the child was caſt out with them, how holy ſoever their Anceſtors had been, as we inſtanced in the Jews; therefore admiſſion is with the immediate parents as well as ejection. (2) From that place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Elſe were your children unclean,</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks it as knowing no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of their federal ſanctification, neither will that take it away to ſay, becauſe their Anceſtors were Heathen, for there is but one way of ſanctifying Heathens by profeſſion, and thoſe that are as Heathens in their converſation. (3) There is no ſtop; if a federal right from Anceſtors will not wear out, how ſhall a man know where to ſtay? and if it muſt be thought to reach to all their ſucceeding generations, then we muſt baptize all mankind; therefore there is no certainty, unleſs we pitch here. (4) Sacraments are to be adminiſtred only unto Church-members, and if parents have no right to memberſhip they can convey none; but it was not enough to make a member to be baptized, and to make profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith in a Chriſtian Church, and therefore being himſelf no member, he cannot convey a right of memberſhip. (5) From the inconveniences that muſt needs follow upon it. 1. The Ordinance is profaned by promiſcuous adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 2. Miniſters are put to act upon uncertainties. 3. Wicked men are hardned and incouraged that cry, <hi>The Temple of the Lord are we,</hi> and all the Lords people are holy, which formerly I am ſure many of our Divines bitterly complained of. (6) I was much the more led into it, becauſe of many things that I have met with in the Writings both of ancient and modern Divines to that purpoſe, ſome of which were quoted, and there are many more that might be added, but it's not fit for a Pulpit and a popular Auditory, this being, as you know, not a Doctrine of my fetching in, but that which Providence in the courſe of my Miniſtry did put me upon; I confeſs I durſt not wave it, though in my own inclination I could willingly have done it; neither was it out of a deſire of novelty to be the Broacher of ſome new Doctrine or Opinion amongſt you, God is my witneſs; I know <hi>nihil novandum niſi quod traditum;</hi> yet conceiving it after my beſt examination to be a truth of God, for I did deſire to believe before I ſpake, I could not but ſpeak what I apprehended to be the mind of God therein; I ſhould not deſire to obtrude any thing upon you without examination, if it be upon tryal but hay and ſtubble, I ſhall be content that it ſhall burn; but if it be a truth of God, it will abide the tryal; and though ſuch a truth as this is may receive ſome prejudice by the weakneſs of the inſtrument, yet if it be a truth the Lord
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:52030:133" rendition="simple:additions"/> Jeſus will certainly raiſe up ſuch inſtruments as ſhall be able to carry it through againſt all oppoſition.</p>
                  <p>I come now to anſwer the former Objection. I do acknowledge that there is no way for the Gentiles to come under <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant but by faith; they cannot claim a title from <hi>Abraham</hi> begetting, that belongs to the Jews only, who are therefore called by the Apoſtle the natural Branches,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.24.</note> and the Gentiles are ſaid to be ingrafted contrary unto na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore the Gentiles can claim no intereſt in <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant but from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Abraham;</hi> and yet I deny that the faith which ſhall give a man any kind of right or title muſt be true, ſaving, and juſtifying faith.</p>
                  <p>And to clear this, I muſt give you a threefold diſtinction: 1. Of <hi>Abraham</hi> as a father; and it's plain, that the Scripture ſpeaks of a threefold paternity of <hi>Abraham.</hi> (1) <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is a natural father, and ſo to the Jews only; for they are his poſterity according to the fleſh, the natural branches that grow out of this root; and this is the paternity that the Jews did glory in: <hi>We have Abraham to our father.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 3.9. Joh. 8.39.</note> (2) <hi>Abraham</hi> is a ſpiritual father unto all true Believers, who walk in the ſteps of the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whether they be of the Jews, or of the Gentiles, and they ſhall be bleſſed with faithful <hi>Abraham;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 4.11, 12.</note> for which cauſe I ſuppoſe it is, that Heaven is called <hi>Abrahams boſom,</hi>

                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.22. <hi>Abraham</hi> being the father of all the Faithful, they ſhall be received into the ſame happineſs with himſelf, and he will ſhew unto them ſpecial love and tenderneſs, <hi>Infantes in parentum ſinu geſtati amorem &amp; benevolentiam intimam experiuntur;</hi> and ſo to be gathered to the Saints, our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is a ſpecial mercy, becauſe we ſhall have an experience of the higheſt love of the Saints; even <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, the father of us all will owne us for his ſons, and receive us into his boſom. Others take it as a Metaphor from the cuſtom of the Jews <hi>in conviviis, in their feaſts,</hi> where they did <hi>alter in alterius ſinu occumbere, lye down one in the others boſom, Joh.</hi> 13.23. anſwerable unto that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.11. <hi>They ſhall ſit down with Abraham, Iſaac,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 11.16.</note> as it appears <hi>Rom</hi> 11.16. he is the <hi>root</hi> upon which the Churches of the Jews did grow, and into which the Churches of the Gentiles are ingrafted: many of the Jews were not ſpiritually his ſeed, and yet they are ſaid to be broken off, not from being <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural ſeed, that they could never be deprived of, they were the poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh, and ſo they do remain even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their breaking off; but they are only broken off from a Church-relation, and ſo they are the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> no more: and the Gentiles are grafted, not into <hi>Abraham</hi> as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural father, a natural root; for they never can be the poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to nature, and many of them are not from him as a ſpiritual father; for many of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not, and therefore are in danger of being cut off, as the Jews were broken off; whence they grow upon <hi>Abraham,</hi> and are ingrafted into him as an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> or <hi>Church-father.</hi> So then the anſwer is, there is not a ſufficient enumeration of <hi>Abrahams</hi> paternities. It's confeſſed, the Gentiles cannot become the poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> as a natural father, or as a ſpiritual father, for ſo many of the Gentiles are not of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as do not walk in the ſteps of his faith; but yet <hi>Abraham</hi> is an Eccleſiaſtical father unto the Gentiles, as well as he was to the Jews that believed not; for the Gentiles are ingrafted into the ſame root, out of which the natural branches were broken off, which cannot be ſpoken of his faith and grace that's never broken off, therefore it is of his Eccleſiaſtical or Church reſpect it muſt be meant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the Covenant of <hi>Abraham</hi> there are two parts, the one ſpiritual, conſiſting in the inward graces and priviledges; the other external, conſiſting in outward priviledges on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and this doth plainly appear in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who was the child of the free woman, and unto whom the Covenant deſcended according to the ſpiritual graces and priviledges thereof; and in <hi>Iſmael,</hi> who was the ſon of the bond-woman, born after the fleſh, and taken into covenant only in reference to the external priviledges thereof:<note place="margin">Deut. 29.10, 12, 13, 14.

                     <note place="margin">Gen. 17.21.</note> ſo God ſaith of Believers children, that he will not eſtabliſh his Covenant with them as to inward grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Yet the Lord will continue the Covenant from parents to children by a kind of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal deſcent in reference to the external priviledges of the Covenant, and they ſhall be conveyed from parents unto the children, who ſhall have a Covenant-right as the parents priviledge: and the grounds of it are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) Becauſe the Lord will have a viſible Church out of the loyns of his own people; therefore when he takes in their parents into a Church-covenant, he takes in alſo their children; they are the <hi>children of the kingdom,</hi> becauſe they are the children of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that God made with their parents. He doth indeed take in as Proſelytes, ſome here, and ſome there; but the viſible Church is chiefly and generally made up of ſuch confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate parents and their children: and to make a viſible Church there is required outward ordinances and priviledges, that there may be a difference put between them and the reſt of the world,<note place="margin">Exod. 19.5.</note> that they may be unto God <hi>a holy and a peculiar people;</hi> and this may be where the graces of the Covenant are not diſpenſed, yet the priviledges of the Covenant muſt. It's true, there are <hi>tares</hi> among the <hi>wheat</hi> in the ſame field, and there are <hi>goats</hi> feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt the <hi>ſheep</hi> in the ſame paſture; it's not grace (as you heard) makes a man a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble member of the Church viſible, for it cannot be ſeen, it cannot properly come under any humane judgment; but it's grace makes a man a member of the inviſible Church into which Chriſt only admits, and that which Chriſt only judges, and not man.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) The Covenant is entailed in reference to the priviledges thereof, that the Lord might magnifie and exalt his love unto parents the more; and that it might be a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to come into Covenant with God, becauſe the promiſe ſhall be <hi>unto you and your children, even unto them that are afar off, or as many as the Lord ſhall call;</hi> not only to the Jews and their children, but alſo to the Gentiles, for that is meant by <hi>afar off, Eph.</hi> 2.17. all that ſhall be converted and take hold of the Covenant for themſelves, their poſterity ſhall be taken into their Covenant-right alſo, and that's the inducement and the argument uſed <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. The great plague of ſin lies in this, that a man does not only undo himſelf, but his poſterity, as it was in <hi>Adam;</hi> and the great comfort in grace is, that a man ſhall do good to his poſterity, as it was promiſed to Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.29. <hi>filiabitur nomen ejus, his name ſhall be continued amongst his poſterity</hi> in the Church. Now for God to give a man a name in his poſterity to owne them, it's a great mercy, to ſpeak of a mans houſe a great while for to come: and it's exceedingly heightned by this; <hi>Adams</hi> ſin was imputed to his poſterity, as well as his grace; now the priviledges of the Fathers Covenant ſhall be entail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the ſins of the parents are perſonal, and ſhall never be imputed unto the children. It's true, that the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> is imputed, but the ſin of the immediate parents is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto the children; and though God doth <hi>viſit the iniquity of the parents upon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> yet it is as true, <hi>that the children do not bear the iniquities of the fathers;</hi> ſo that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers priviledges are the childrens, but the fathers ſins are his own; for every man now ſins as a private perſon for himſelf, not as a publick perſon, as a repreſentative head, as <hi>Adam</hi> did for himſelf and his poſterity.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) The Lord would engage their children to himſelf above all the Families and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities of the Earth,<note place="margin">Ezech. 16.</note> and therefore he calls them <hi>the children born unto him; thou haſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken my ſons and my daughters that thou haſt born to me;</hi> and they ſhall have the Priviledge that none upon Earth have, that thereby they may be engaged to God; and if they be wicked, they may be the more left without excuſe: as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſays, <hi>in Orat.</hi> 40. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:52030:135"/> of ſpiritual and Church-priviledges, that's beyond what other men injoy, the Lord would bind them that are his Covenant-people unto himſelf by this cord, beyond the reſt of the world.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4) To ſhew forth the goodneſs and overflowing mercy of Chriſt, under the ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, unto unregenerate men, who for the ſtate of their perſons are under the Covenant of Works, and are enemies unto the Covenant of Grace, and yet they ſhall injoy many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and benefits thereby; and this the Lord does beſtow upon them either as prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and as means to fit them for ſervices, or as priviledges and rewards of ſervices; for all the creatures are now given into the hands of Chriſt, and all men in the Church belong to him; they all come under him either as ſervants or as ſons; they that are ſons partake in the graces of the Covenant, but the ſervants alſo partake in the priviledges of it, for they abide in the houſe, though not for ever, and while they are in the houſe they have bread enough and to ſpare, they partake of the root and fatneſs of the good Olive-tree; they have Church-ordinances that fit them for ſervice, and they receive Church priviledges as temporal rewards of ſervice.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5) For the Elects ſake; there are ſome upon whom the grace of the Covenant is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, and unto whom the Priviledges of the Covenant do chiefly belong, and they are the Elect of God; but becauſe they are bound up in the ſame bundle with the reſt of mankind, and men cannot diſtinguiſh, for it is electing Love that puts the difference; therefore as Ordinances are continued unto all for the Elects ſake, ſo Priviledges are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon all; but the primary intention of them is for the Saints, the Elect of God, that they might partake in them for whom they were ſpecially purchaſed and intended. As the preaching of the Goſpel was primarily intended for the Elect of God, that they might partake in it, and for the gathering in of Souls unto him; but becauſe the Elect of God are amongſt the wicked of the world, therefore if men be to diſpenſe Ordinances, they muſt do it in common, and wait upon God in the uſe of them, and the grace of God will fall upon the Elect unto Converſion; and ſo it does accidentally come upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men; but primarily and intentionally, it is given only for the Elects ſake; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by this, that when the Lord has finiſhed and gather'd in the number of the Elect, he will continue Ordinances and Church-priviledges unto unregenerate men no longer; therefore as Ordinances being diſpenſed by men, muſt be in common for the Elects ſake, ſo muſt priviledges diſpenſed by men be alſo: as the World ſtands for the Saints, and yet ungodly men enjoy much of the comforts of the world, that a man would think it were all for their ſakes; ſo Church-priviledges are vouchſafed to ungodly men as a great part of the Church, that a man would think all were for their ſakes, and yet it is with a ſpecial reſpect and primary intention to the Saints, that both the one and the other are continued in the world; wicked men ſhall ſhare with the Saints in the external pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, rather than the Saints of God be wholly deprived of them: And upon theſe grounds I conceive, it mainly is that the Covenant is entailed from father to ſon for the outward priviledges, but not for the inward graces thereof.</p>

(1) I ſay one Ordinance cannot be inſtitutive of another; for Inſtitutions do depend purely upon the will of God, manifeſted to the creature in matter of Worſhip, and therefore it were ſinfull to ſay, Becauſe there were two Sacraments under the Old Teſtament, therefore there muſt be two under the New, and becauſe there was one Sacrament of Initiation, and the other of Confirmation, therefore it muſt be ſo under the New, unleſs we had a word from Chriſt that did war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant it; or to ſay, Becauſe they had a Sabbath amongſt the Jews, a day of Religious reſt, therefore we muſt have ſo amongſt the Gentiles that are now Chriſtians, unleſs we have a word that doth manifeſt this to be the will of God, that he will in ſuch Ordinances be worſhipped in the Church: and therefore we are far from making <hi>Circumciſion</hi> to be the

                  <p n="4">4. Though no inſtitution of the Old Teſtament can be the ground of any inſtitution of the New, but barely the will of the Law-giver, yet in many things the inſtitutions of the Old Teſtament may give rules, and in ſeveral particulars afford arguments to regulate thoſe of the New. As, though I do not ſay, that the Jewiſh Sabbath was inſtitutive of the Lords day (as ſome do) and that it was no new inſtitution, but remained by virtue of the fourth Commandment, and though the day be changed, yet it hath the ſame inſtitution
<pb facs="tcp:52030:137"/> ſtill; yet I ſuppoſe that many arguments may be drawn from the Jewiſh obſervations, as directions for the Chriſtian Sabbath: as (1) The Jews in their Sabbath did conſecrate to God the whole ſeventh day, that is, a natural day, conſiſting of 24 hours, and therefore were derided by the Heathen in loſing the ſeventh part of their lives; ſo it's the duty of Chriſtians to give the ſame time unto God, as great a proportion in their Sabbath as the Jews did. (2) The Jews in their Sabbath were to do no ſervile work, only our Lord Chriſt lets them ſee that works of piety and of charity and neceſſity might be done upon that day; and ſo are the Chriſtians to celebrate their Sabbath alſo, by doing no ſervile work. (3) The Jews were not only to take care of the obſervation of the Sabbath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,<note place="margin">Nehem. 13.19.</note> but alſo that all that were under their charge, the Magiſtrate in his place; as <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> did give forth a commandment, he did ſet his ſervants to obſerve that it was done, and he did threaten even the ſtrangers, that if they did not reform, <hi>he would lay hands on them,</hi> which he would ſurely have done, had the ſin been continued in; but it's ſaid, <hi>That from that time they came no more upon the Sabbath:</hi> and ſurely this duty lies upon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrate alſo, and it's his ſin if he do it not; and ſo for private perſons in reference to their families: <hi>Thou and thy ſon and thy daughter, thy man ſervant,</hi> &amp;c. (4) The Jews did meet to worſhip God publickly upon the Sabbath day, and there they had the Law and the Prophets read and preached to them every Sabbath day; and from hence it's a good argument to infer the publick meeting of Chriſtians to worſhip God publickly upon their Sabbath,<note place="margin">Act. 13.27. &amp; 15.21.</note> and that part of this worſhip ſhould be a conſtant reading and publiſhing the will of God in the Law, and in the Prophets, and in the Goſpel. It will be a hard matter to find rules for this under the New Teſtament; but we muſt be regulated by the practice of the inſtitutions under the former adminiſtrations. I conceive it will be in this counted but a ſlender anſwer to ſay, The inſtitutions of the Old Teſtament muſt in nothing regulate thoſe of the New; and that argument drawn from them by way of Analogy or <hi>à pari ratione</hi> is but the preſumption of man, and can no way reach the mind of God. The like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I may give for the publick worſhip of God; his commands or inſtitutions given to the Jews and their practice will be good arguments to regulate us Chriſtians. (1) They did with a great deal of diligence and conſcience frequent the place of publick worſhip three times a year at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and in their Synagogue every Sabbath day: <hi>They went from ſtrength to ſtrength every year appearing before God in Sion.</hi> (2) Their coming at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſtaying during the whole time of the ſervice, as <hi>Ezech.</hi> 46.10. when the people ſhall go in, he ſhall go in, and when the people go forth, he ſhall alſo go forth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (3) We are to behave our ſelves with a great deal of reverence during all the time of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.30. <hi>Ye ſhall reverence my Sanctuary.</hi> (4) That you are not to depart without a bleſſing, which is to be done by way of Office in the Name of Chriſt as an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;<note place="margin">Num. 6.27.</note> 
                     <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons did bleſs the people. It will be hard for a man to find rules for theſe in the New Teſtament, and yet it will be as hard to ſay, that theſe inſtitutions and commands of the Old Teſtament ſhould not regulate us under the New. We have another inſtance of <hi>Tithes,</hi> which was a legal inſtitution under the Old Teſtament; I would not enter upon any unwelcome Diſputes about it, the Apoſtle lays down this as a rule, <hi>That he that ſerves at the Altar, ſhould live of the Altar;</hi> he ſhould receive by the Law of God from his people as a reward of his labour, and as a teſtification of the honour that is due unto him, ſuch a maintenance as may be a ſupport and ſupply for neceſſaries to him and his, that <hi>he ſhould not go to warfare at his own charge.</hi> I do not ſpeak theſe things out of partiality and affection unto my own cauſe and calling; but the Law ſays the ſame, <hi>Thou ſhalt not muzle the mouth of the ox; doth God take care for oxen?</hi> It is ſpoken there for our ſakes, that the incouragement of the Miniſters in their ſervice might depend upon the Law of God, and not on the will, humours, and allowances of covetous cruel men. And our Divines reaſon commonly from the manner of Gods dealing with the Prieſts and Levites under the Law, and from thence argue the care that God takes of his Miniſters,<note place="margin">Lev. 27.30. Num. 35.2.</note> and that it muſt be a free and a liberal maintenance; for they had the tenth of all the increaſe of ſeed or fruit, of all their great and ſmall cattel, they had forty eight Cities with their Suburbs; they had all the firſt-fruits alſo, beſides the ſin-offering, the meat-offering, all their vows and voluntary oblations; and from a parity of reaſon, they do infer that the like care ought to be taken and the like maintenance in the days of the Goſpel. And whereas the people (though in a poor condition) failing in this, are ſaid to rob God, and therefore are curſed with a curſe, that <hi>they did ſow much and bring in little;</hi> they do from thence conclude and infer, that where the like ſin remains, it will be looked upon by God with the ſame eye,<note place="margin">Mal. 3.7.</note> and will ſurely be followed by him with the ſame curſe; and many ſuch inſtances may be given of rules to be drawn from Old Teſtament-inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to regulate men in many things of the New, or elſe we ſhall in many things be left without direction.</p>

T. unto thoſe of the New, and it will appear, that every poſition hath enough in Scripture to warrant it. (1) Our Baptiſm is the ſeal of the ſame Covenant that Circumciſion was; then the Covenant of Grace was the ſame for ſubſtance with that under the New Teſtament; for it's <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant that was ſealed in Circumciſion, and ſo it is in Baptiſm alſo; for <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Abraham</hi> is the father of all that are circumciſed, and of all that are uncircumciſed alſo; to that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the righteouſneſs whereof is the righteouſneſs of faith, that of Circumciſion was a ſeal, and we are alſo baptized into Chriſt, into his Death and Reſurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">(2) The perſons taken into Covenant of old were the children and their parents: <hi>I will be thy God and the God of thy ſeed;</hi> their children are the ſons of the Covenant, and of the promiſe that God made with their fathers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This has been, manifeſted not only under the Law, but before the Law, from the beginning, and alſo under the Goſpel; the Lord, as he did caſt off the Jews and their children, ſo he took in the Gentiles and their children into Covenant with himſelf; and though they were by nature the wild Olive-tree,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> yet they were ingrafted into the good Olive-tree, and do partake of the root and fatneſs thereof; and when he will take in the Jews again, they ſhall be taken in they and their ſeed, as they and their ſeed were diſinherited and caſt out.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) That Baptiſm ſucceeds in the room and place of Circumciſion as the ſeal of the ſame Covenant and as the Ordinance of Initiation: which will appear, (1) Becauſe the end was the ſame in both, <hi>viz.</hi> to be the Sacrament of admiſſion of viſible members. (2) Becauſe the grace of the thing ſignified is the ſame, Circumciſion is cutting off of the body of ſins in the fleſh, and Baptiſm a being buried with Chriſt in his death by a work of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo much the Apoſtle doth intimate, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11, 12. he had ſaid we need joyn nothing of the Law, for <hi>we are compleat in Chriſt,</hi> and therefore need none of the Jewiſh Rites any more; and becauſe they ſtood much upon Circumciſion, therefore he gives that inſtance, <hi>We are circumciſed with a better Circumciſion,</hi> that of which the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the Jews was but the Type; and whereas they might have ſaid, but they had Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, which was to them as a viſible ſign the more to confirm them; and therefore though we have the inward grace, yet we are not ſo compleat as they, becauſe we want the outward ſign; therefore he tells them, that priviledge is not wanting to the Chriſtian no more than to the Jews, for we have a Sacrament to the ſame uſe and end, <hi>being buried with him in baptiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">(4) To thoſe that are the children of the Covenant, taken into Covenant, the ſeal of admiſſion into it doth belong; becauſe God took all the Jews into Covenant, they and their ſeed, therefore they were all of them circumciſed: The ſeal of viſible admiſſion can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to none that are within the Covenant; but the children of confederate parents are within the Covenant alſo under the New Teſtament; therefore unto them the ſeal of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble admiſſion is to be adminiſtred: ſo that as under the Old Teſtament none were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but by Circumciſion, ſo under the New none are to be admitted into the Church but by Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5) The children under the New Teſtament are as capable of the grace of Baptiſm, as under the Old Teſtament they were of the grace of Circumciſion; yea they are as capable being children, as if they were men; for <hi>nulla actio requiritur à recipientibus, ſed tantùm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptio paſſiva:</hi> all that is done being acts of God upon a man, unto which the perſon can contribute nothing at all, they are therefore repreſented by Chriſt in his death and reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; thoſe that are united unto Chriſt, receiving the Spirit of Chriſt, are baptized for the remiſſion and purging away of ſins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All the benefits that the Scripture ſpeaks of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, the ſubject is paſſive therein: and therefore we may upon theſe Principles ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Lord having inſtituted this Ordinance in the room of Circumciſion, has conveyed the ſame grace; and it being ordained to the ſame ends, though the ſimilitude of it be not expreſly ſet down in Scripture, yet we may lawfully fetch the ſimilitude of it from that of Circumciſion, as we do many Rules for Ordinances in the New Teſtament from the Old wherein the New is ſilent.</p>

(1) The <hi>Olive-tree</hi> is the Church of God, as formerly was ſhewed out of <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.16. <hi>The Lord called thy name a green Olive-tree,</hi> &amp;c. it's ſpoken of the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which is in Scripture ſometimes compared unto a <hi>Palm tree, Cant.</hi> 7.8. and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to a <hi>Vine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 80.14.</note> 
                     <hi>I planted thee a noble Vine, Jer.</hi> 2.21. therefore Jews and Gentiles make up one Olive-tree, they are all of them but one Church, all of them are branches of the ſame Olive-tree. (2) The <hi>Root</hi> of this Tree was <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Church covenant that God did make with him, and in him with his ſeed, and ſo I conceive the root is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, [1] For the Covenant that God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was the root upon which <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf and all his ſeed did grow, and from whence their fatneſs was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, and that I conceive is meant <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>Thou partakeſt of the root of the Olive-tree;</hi> it's the Covenant upon which the Church is built, and upon which as a root it grows, and ſo though ſome of the branches are broken off, yet the root is not taken up, but it remains ſtill for others to be grafted upon; it is ſpoken of the Covenant which is the ſame where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon both Jews and Gentiles do grow. [2] It is put for <hi>Abraham</hi> with whom this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was firſt made, and in whom after a ſort the Covenant began; and ſo I conceive Root is taken <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. <hi>If the root be holy, ſo are the branches;</hi> neither is there any inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience to ſay that the Covenant is the Root upon which <hi>Abraham</hi> and all the reſt of his branches did grow, and alſo that <hi>Abraham</hi> was the Root from which his ſeed did grow up into Covenant; for he was the Root only by virtue of the Covenant, which did in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner begin with him, and by virtue of this Covenant all his ſeed were as ſo many branches to grow upon him, and were owned as a Church unto God. (3) As the Olive-tree is the Church, and that is but one, and the Root is the Covenant, and that is but one; ſo the branches of this Olive-tree are to grow upon this Root: and though many of the natural branches were broken off, yet that does not make void the Covenant, the Root ſtill remains the ſame for others to be grafted in upon, and ſome branches were grafted in that were taken out of another ſtock, and that never grew upon this Covenant, and their grafting in was being made members of the Church, who were before ſtrangers to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Covenant of promiſe, and ſtanding upon the Root was being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into Covenant; ſo that he that is taken into Covenant is thereby made a Church-member. Whoſoever therefore is taken into Covenant with God, and hath a federal rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto God, that man is grafted into the Root, and is made a branch of the true Olive-tree, and grows upon the ſame Root that all the Saints of God do grow on; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be taken into Covenant, and to be made a member of the viſible Church, is in the notion of the Spirit of God, and in the language of the Scripture the ſame thing. Whence it appears, that there is but one Covenant between Jews and Gentiles, one Root that bears them both.</p>

                     <hi>for the external Ordinances thereof:</hi> There are three things in the Doctrine of the Covenant that are carefully to be diſtinguiſh'd; (1) There is a twofold being in Chriſt, one by a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Union, ſo he that is in Chriſt is a New Creature; and the other by an external Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; and ſo as Chriſt is a Vine ſpreading himſelf into a viſible Church,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.17.</note> he has many unfruitfull branches. (2) The Covenant has two parts; [1] One <hi>inward</hi> and ſpiritual, which is by Faith and Converſion, and the benefits of it are Juſtification, Adoption, and Sanctification, which is the Covenant ſpoken of, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;</hi> [2] Another <hi>external,</hi> which entitles a man to the outward priviledges only, and this is the Covenant in regard of the outward admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations owning them for a viſible Church of God; thus God is ſaid to break with the Jews; for the Covenant of Grace in the ſpiritual part of it is everlaſting,<note place="margin">Zach. 11.10.</note> and cannot be broken. (3) Anſwerable to this two-fold conſideration of the Covenant, ſo there are different Seals annex'd thereunto; unto the ſpiritual part of the Covenant there is added the <hi>Seal of the Spirit,</hi> which is ſecret between God and the Soul;<note place="margin">Eph. 1.13. &amp; 4.30.</note> and unto the external part of the Covenant there are added viſible Seals before men, and theſe viſible Seals are different amongſt the Jews and the Chriſtians; the Ordinance and Seal of Admiſſion amongſt the Jews was Circumciſion, but it's Baptiſm amongſt Chriſtians; therefore the adminiſtration is varyed, though the Covenant remain the ſame;<note place="margin">Heb. 9.10.</note> and for this cauſe the times of the Goſpel are call'd the <hi>times of Reformation;</hi> that is, when all theſe weak and beggerly Elements, though they were Gods Ordinances, ſhould be removed, and new and more ſpiritual and unchangeable Ordinances ſtabliſhed in their room; for the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Adminiſtrations of the Goſpel are thoſe that ſhall never be changed; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the ſame to the end of the world; as they are the beſt, ſo they ſhall be the laſt; as theſe Two places do clearly prove, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go teach and baptize all Nations, and I am with you to the end of the world;</hi> therefore that adminiſtration ſhall never be changed; and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Ye ſhew forth the Lords death till he come;</hi> therefore that Adminiſtration ſhall laſt unto the ſecond coming of the Lord.<note place="margin">Heb. 8.7.</note> There is a double time that the Saints of God in all ages have had a ſpecial eye upon; they in the Old Teſtament upon the times, or as it is, the <gap reason="foreign">

But none of theſe did enter upon their title by Circumciſion; and yet when the Lord did renew his Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his poſterity, and took them as a viſible Church unto himſelf, all that would lay claim to an intereſt in the Covenant muſt ſubmit unto that adminiſtration; and that being put to an end, and the Lord having put the Covenant under a new adminiſtration, all that

                     <hi>That the partition-wall was taken down, Eph.</hi> 2.14, 15. that was between the two ſorts of people, that then did divide the world, the Jews and the Gentiles; and that was <hi>the Law of Commandments contained in Ordinances,</hi> that is, the preſent adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſo both people might be joyned into one, that the Jew could now claim no more right to the external adminiſtration of the Covenant than the Gentiles, becauſe the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances unto which they did claim a Covenant-right were taken away, and God had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed new ones, and ſetled the Covenant of Grace in the world under new adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and unto them the Jews muſt ſubmit as well as the Gentiles, or elſe they can have no federal right to the outward priviledges thereof, either for themſelves, or for their ſeed: and upon this ground, though the Jews were members of the viſible Church of God under former adminiſtrations, yet they can claim no ſuch viſible memberſhip in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Goſpel, becauſe the former adminiſtrations unto which they did lay claim was come to an end, and the Jew muſt believe, and repent, and be baptized as well as the Chriſtian, and then the promiſe ſhall be unto him and to his children, but never elſe.</p>

Some of our Divines do ſay, that a Covenant cannot ſo properly be ſaid to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man, as between man and man; for amongſt them conſent is required to make the Covenant valid, but an antecedent conſent is not required in the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man; and ſo they ſay the Covenant that God made with <hi>Adam</hi> did not depend upon conſent and acceptation; for he was bound to do what God commanded, whether he would agree to it or no, and he was bound to accept of what God required. And it's by ſome diſputed, <hi>Whether Adam did know or give his conſent that he ſhould ſtand as a publick perſon in the behalf of his poſterity to ſtand and fall for them, and they in him,</hi> &amp;c. But this is an anſwer I cannot reſt in, I look upon conſent as eſſentially neceſſary to a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant both between God and man, as well as between man and man; and ſo I find that in the Covenant that God made with Chriſt and with the Saints, a conſent has always been required thereunto: and that <hi>Adam</hi> did know the terms of the Covenant by which he ſtood, and did conſent unto them for himſelf and his poſterity, we ſaw the grounds of it before in the Doctrine of the former Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Infants may enter into Covenant with God doth clearly appear, (1) In that Circumciſion amongſt the Jews, the ſeal of the Covenant, was applied unto them; and they muſt be <hi>foederati, federates,</hi> or elſe they could never have been <hi>ſignati, ſealed ones;</hi> the ſeal of the Covenant is only to be adminiſtred unto them that are within the Covenant. (2) God takes them into Covenant,<note place="margin">Deut. 29.11, 12.</note> as <hi>Moſes</hi> tells them, <hi>Ye ſtand this day before the Lord, all the men of Iſrael, your wives and your little ones, that thou ſhouldſt enter into covenant with
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:52030:139"/> the Lord thy God,</hi> &amp;c. therefore the Lord did not only take the men into covenant that were grown, and able to give an actual conſent, but alſo their little ones, that neither were able to ſpeak or conſent to the terms of this covenant. (3) It is plain, that children are members of the viſible Church: <hi>Of ſuch is the kingdom of heaven;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 19.14.</note> which can be meant no other way, but that of ſuch is the viſible Church of God conſtituted, they are of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe that make up part of the Church here, and that ſhall fill up Heaven hereafter. Now to be a member of the viſible Church, and to be one in Covenant with God is all one, for it is the grafting of a branch into the Stock, and growing of it upon the root of the Covenant that makes it a viſible member; <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. As the children are brought into Covenant by a parental right and not a perſonal, ſo to the being in Covenant the conſent of the Parents is in Gods account accepted, and a perſonal conſent is not required: but as when the Parent doth diſſent, he doth thereby keep the child out of Covenant, as all the Heathens do, who do not conſent to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and the Jews did, that caſt off and rejected the Word of Life; ſo when Parents do conſent, they bring their children within the Covenant, which runs unto them and their ſeed as confederates; it's therefore the conſent of the Parents that is in God's account taken for the conſent of the child. As God did under the firſt Covenant include all the conſent of <hi>Adams</hi> Poſterity in the firſt man, and they all conſented in his conſent; and therefore <hi>all ſinn'd in him,</hi> and violated the Covenant; ſo the Lord binds up the conſent of the child in reference to the Covenant, in the conſent of the Parents; he conſents for himſelf, and his ſeed alſo. <hi>Gell. Succanus,</hi> in his book <hi>de baptiſmo</hi> lays down two Rules that are of excellent uſe unto the preſent Queſtion, that the Covenant of Grace is to take in the ſeed together with the Parents. (1) It is a ſpecial over-flowing of Grace to the Parents, which they are to believe, and conſent unto: for though the benefit of it does come upon the children, yet it is the Parents priviledge, and it is a part of the Goſpel of Grace, that he is to give conſent unto, and his faith takes hold of, that God will be the God of his ſeed, as well as of himſelf; he is to take hold of the Covenant in all the parts of it, that is, not for himſelf only, but for his ſeed alſo. (2) <hi>All Infants,</hi>

And if the Lord will impute the conſent of Parents to their children, ſo as to own them as his in Covenant with him, according to the Word, till they do themſelves manifeſt their diſſent, and caſt off the Covenant of their God, he may juſtly do it, and yet God, according to the Rules of his Word does count them, though they belong not to the Election of Grace, as confederates and in Covenant with himſelf; it's no wonder if the Church alſo do while they ſo remain, own them for members, and thoſe that are in a viſible Covenant, the conſent of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

(2) Hereby <hi>infantes dignitatis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignia gerunt, Infants bear the Enſigns of their dignity;</hi> that they are taken out of the world, have the Name of God call'd upon them, and by Covenant are the children of God, and members of the viſible Church, of the number of thoſe out of whom the Lord will take ordinarily the number of the Elect; for he hath ſo ordain'd his eternal Decrees, that the greateſt part of thoſe that ſhall be ſaved, come out of the loyns of his own people, and thoſe he takes into a Church-covenant, becauſe the children of the Elect are mixed with, and taken out of the Church viſible; and to be without ſuch a title of Honour as God has put upon the Infants of his people, is it better than to enjoy it, ſeeing free grace beſtows it?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The one half of the Church of God, as well as the one half of Man-kind dye in their Infancy, and do never live to partake of the Dews and Influences of any other Ordinance, but this only; and if they might not be owned by God in having the Seal of the Covenant ſet to them as the children of the Covenant, they ſhould go out of the world without any viſible owning from God at all, or any viſible way of bleſſing from him; whereas the ſame Lord that will glorifie them with his Son in the world to come, will own them for his in a viſible way, before they go out of this life, and he has appointed this Ordinance of Sealing to this very end.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If they live, it's an Obligation that lyes upon them, that they are not their own; for they were dedicated to God by their Parents in their Infancy. There was under the Law a Dedication of the Males, and that was an Obligation upon the child, as we ſee in <hi>Sampſon</hi> and <hi>Samuel;</hi> though they did not actually conſent unto the Vows which were made by their Parents, yet their Dedication was a bond upon them; and ſo muſt this needs be upon the children of Chriſtians alſo.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fruits of Baptiſm have an influence upon a mans whole life, and the benefits of it carry a man on from his Cradle to his Grave, and it's all the nouriſhment that children do enjoy, or in Infancy can receive, from Ordinances; therefore <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.2. it's ſaid by ſome to be called the Navel by which the Child in the womb is nouriſhed; a mans Baptiſm and the Grace of it is never accompliſhed till he come to Heaven; for Baptiſm ſaves; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having an influence upon a mans whole life, it's not beſt to leave it out in any part of a man's life.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It lays a great engagement upon the Parents to bring them up in the knowledge of that God to whom they have dedicated them, and whoſe Seal is upon them, and that they pray for them, and in their behalf take hold of the Covenant; and it layes alſo a very great Obligation upon the Church to which the Parents belong; for they looking upon thoſe children as Church-members together with themſelves, they fall under their conſtant care, and prayers: in all theſe reſpects, it is not better that it be deferred, but it's every way beſt that it be according to Gods Rule, and that our will be wholly moulded into the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his will.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. As for the Example of Chriſt, it's true, that he was not baptized till he was Thirty years of age, but he was circumciſed the Eighth day, and ſo admitted into the Church of the Jews, and ſo long as that building was to continue, ſo long he continued a Church-member, and walked in Church-communion with them; but the time of Reformation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, that the Lord would by him ſet up another Church, now he receives a new Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Initiation, which was proper to the new Adminiſtration of the Covenant, that he might fulfill all Righteouſneſs: but for us there is not the ſame reaſon, neither have we now any other way to be received into the Church in our Infancy, beſide Baptiſm, and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:52030:140"/> children are as capable of the grace of Baptiſm in their infancy, as they will be when they are grown men; for it's a good rule of ſome Divines, <hi>Nulla actio requiritur,</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> 1. To ſhew the evil and danger of the Doctrine of the Antipedobaptiſts, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unto children an intereſt in their parents Covenant, take parents into covenant without their children, they muſt be left out until they come to be of years, actually to take hold of the covenant for themſelves; but as for a parental right, they acknowledge no ſuch thing; ſuch an entail of the covenant upon <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural ſeed they cannot deny, but unto the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> they deny it, becauſe, ſay they, it's every mans own faith makes him a ſon of <hi>Abraham.</hi> And by this means, (1) they make another covenant than God ever made, a covenant with parents not reſpecting their children, which is ſuch a covenant as God never made, either in the Old or New Teſtament. Before the Floud as ſoon as the covenant was revealed, we have heard that it was unto parents and to their ſeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. and therefore <hi>Eve</hi> was called <hi>the mother of all living,</hi> it's ſpoken in reſpect of the covenant, <hi>Eve</hi> was a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-mother, as <hi>Abraham</hi> is the father of us all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. and it was continued in <hi>Seth,</hi> a ſeed that God gave her not inſtead of <hi>Cain,</hi> who was caſt out of Gods preſence, that is, out of the Church, but inſtead of <hi>Abel,</hi> whom <hi>Cain</hi> ſlew, that is, the covenant-ſeed;<note place="margin">Gen. 6.18. &amp; 9.9.</note> ſo to <hi>Noah</hi> before and after the Floud; afterwards the Lord hews theſe ſpiritual ſtones out of another pit, as the expreſſion is <hi>Eſa.</hi> 51.1, 2. and then with <hi>David</hi> and his ſeed. And the Jews being rejected,<note place="margin">Pſal. 89.28. Rom. 4.16. Act. 2.39.</note> the ſame covenant was continued, for the Gentiles were grafted into the ſame Root, and that root was <hi>Abraham</hi> and his covenant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16, 17. and for this cauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> is called the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Gentiles;</hi> and therefore 'tis ſaid, <hi>The promiſe is unto them that are afar off, and to their children as many as the Lord our God ſhall call:</hi> and when the Jews ſhall be grafted in again, they ſhall be brought they and their children into the ſame covenant,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.24.</note> out of which they were caſt off they and their ſeed. The Scripture ſpeaks of no covenant that doth not comprehend pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and their ſeed; therefore that which leaves out the ſeed of confederate parents is a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of mans making, and not of Gods; and it will be good for men to conſider, what a dangerous evil it is to pervert any order of Gods, as we ſee in <hi>David,</hi> the Lord was provoked againſt him, that he ſmote <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> with death, becauſe they ſought not God according to the due order; and if matters of order be ſo great, what is it for men to vary in matters of faith,<note place="margin">Col. 2.</note> and to change the covenant of God? it's made a great offence, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 24.5. <hi>To change the ordinances of God;</hi> much more that which is the foundation of all Ordinances, the everlaſting Covenant. A man could not act upon a more dangerous way of ſinning, than to change the covenant of God that he hath made with his people.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) By this means there is a great injury done unto children, which are the Embryo's of the Church of God; and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>It's dangerous to offend one of theſe little ones,</hi> they ſhall be ſure of a rebuke from Chriſt, <hi>for of ſuch is the kingdom of God;</hi> to admit any into the Church of God, that the Lord would have ſecluded, is a high provocation and a great unfaithfulneſs in them that have the power of the Keys; but to ſeclude any that the Lord would have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, is a greater provocation. The covenant of grace is not only a covenant,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.15.</note> but a teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that is amongſt men accounted ſo ſacred, that no man diſanulleth it or addeth thereunto; and if we could ſay, that children were ſecluded from the covenant becauſe they cannot reſtipulate, then to blot their names out of the laſt Will and Teſtament of Chriſt, is a horrible injury to the perſons, and a very great preſumption in the man.</p>
                  <p>But there are two ſpecial places that I would name to you for this; one in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1, 2. <hi>Our fathers all paſſed under the cloud, and through the ſea, were baptized into Moſes in the cloud, and in the ſea.</hi> The ſcope I conceive to be this, where there are the like priviledges of grace, there will be the like puniſhments, but we have the like priviledges of grace that they had, therefore we may expect altogether with them the like puniſhments;<note place="margin">Eſtius.</note> ſo <hi>Eſtius</hi> ſays of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits that they received, they were <hi>eorum praefigurativa, prefigurative</hi> of thoſe which we now receive by Chriſt, and therefore he pitches upon two extraordinary Sacraments of the Jews, in which, if in any thing, they might ſeem to be priviledged; but he ſays, that they were alſo as types and examples unto us; and that the Apoſtle had ſuch an intention is plain to me, and that he intended them as ſacramental types, [1] elſe he would never have called them ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb facs="tcp:52030:141"/> meats and drinks: [2] Elſe he would never have ſingled out barely theſe two, giving to one the name of Baptiſm, and to the other the name of ſpiritual Meats. The firſt noted prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for them and their children paſſing under the cloud, and direction alſo; for the cloud did not only go before them as a guide, but it was ſpread alſo over them as a covering: it's ſaid,<note place="margin">Num. 9.15, 16, 19.</note> 
                     <hi>That the cloud covered the Tabernacle,</hi> and ſo it was always, that the cloud covered it by day; and this was a type of that ſpecial protection that the Lord ſeals unto parents and their children in their Baptiſm, for they are baptized in the cloud: and their paſſage through the red Sea, and their preſervation from <hi>Pharaoh</hi> doth ſignifie properly our deliverance from all our ſpiritual enemies, and is commonly made a type of it in the Scripture, and this was a mercy that was vouchſafed unto them and unto their children. Now if the Apoſtles reaſon ſhall be of force, we muſt have the ſame priviledges in Baptiſm that they had in theſe, or elſe the Apoſtles reaſon doth nor can not conclude. Again, Baptiſm is typified by the ſalvation of <hi>Noah</hi> and of his family in the Ark; and the reſemblance ſeems to lye in this, that as the Ark was the Ordinance of God appointed for the ſafety of the Church in the general Deluge, and a family-ſalvation, the father with the child; ſo Baptiſm is the Ordinance that the Lord has appointed for the ſalvation of the Church from the general deſtruction that ſhall befal the world of ungodly, and it doth run by families alſo. Now by this means all theſe incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are denied unto the infants and the families of the Saints, which are the great priviledges in the Scripture given unto them, as they were unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and happened unto them but for types only; and therefore have their accompliſhment in their antitypes under the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) Hereby the practice and prayers of the Churches of Chriſt and all the ancient Saints of God are without any Scripture-ground cauſleſly condemned and rejected as profanations of the Ordinances of God: <hi>Conſuetudo Eccleſiae matris in baptizandis infantibus nequaquam ſpernenda eſt, nec divina credenda niſi Apoſtolica eſſet traditio, Aug. de Geneſ. ad literam, Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 464. And it is a dangerous thing for men to <hi>blaſpheme the Tabernacle of God, and them that dwell in Heaven, Rev.</hi> 13.6. it's an expreſſion of the true Church of God, and to have a mouth given to a man for that end, is not the leaſt ſpiritual judgment, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. there was a mouth given him ſo to ſpeak, and he opened his mouth this way.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hereby we may be informed of the cruelty of unbelieving parents, men that do not only exclude themſelves from the grace of the Covenant, but as much as in them lies their poſterity alſo,<note place="margin">Non pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes, ſed perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, <hi>Bern.</hi>
                     </note> as far as concerns the ordinary way and means of bringing them into Covenant with the Lord. And theſe are of two ſorts: (1) Some that are actually without the Church of God. (2) Some that are not caſt out through the neglect of the Church, but yet they ought ſo to be.</p>

(2) That Church from which the Lord calls to his people for a ſeparation, that the Lord does not owne as a true Church; but the Lord calls upon his people for a ſeparation from the Church of <hi>Rome: Come out of her my people.</hi> And here I conceive with<note n="*" place="margin">Oper.

(3) Where there is no ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be had, that is not a Church unto God; for <hi>extra Eccleſiam nulla ſalus;</hi> but in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by the rules of their own Religion there can be no ſalvation, becauſe they make a man to forſake the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the only foundation in point of Juſtification, which whoſoever miſſeth muſt build upon the ſand, and not upon the Rock, as our own Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> &amp;c. has

                  <p n="2">2. There are another ſort that are not actually caſt out through the negligence of the Church, being able to bear them that be evil, and it's true, while ſuch are owned as members, the priviledges of members cannot be denied to them, who ought to be as a Heathen man and a Publican; and though men do neglect their duty therein, yet there is a kind of ſpiritual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication goes out from God all the while.</p>

[2] When it does not act in the higheſt degree, there is a defect in reference to the object, and in reference unto the act alſo. (3) The people of God have exerciſed faith upon the Covenant for their children; and Chriſt Jeſus himſelf for his children,<note place="margin">Pſal. 102.28. Heb. 1.10, 11, 12.</note> for <hi>he ſhall ſee his ſeed,</hi> and in them <hi>he ſhall prolong his days upon earth;</hi> and therefore we read of his children. There was a Covenant made with Chriſt <hi>perſonal,</hi> and a Covenant made with Chriſt <hi>myſtical,</hi> with him as Mediator, in regard of what he was to perform, and with him as head for us; and Chriſt takes hold of the Covenant in both theſe reſpects, and all promiſes made unto a poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Chriſt has an eye to the accompliſhing of them in the behalf of his poſterity, as well as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as being part of the promiſe and covenant that the Lord made unto him for himſelf and his ſeed: and ſo ſhould all the Faithful do, look upon all the promiſes that are made unto the ſeed of the Faithful in the Scripture, and put them in ſuit before the Lord for thy ſeed alſo, as being part of the Covenant that the Lord has made with you: we might by this means leave and entail very great bleſſings upon our poſterity, and live to ſee the Covenant accompliſhed unto them, unto the great conſolation of our ſouls:<note place="margin">Pſal. 128.3, 4.</note>

It is matter of exhortation unto children, that they would walk worthy of this mercy, this inheritance that God has entailed upon them, and not deſpiſe the grace of God in their parents Covenant, but actually take hold of the Covenant alſo in their own perſons. (1) Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider grace hath prevented you, and you are taken in by God into a familiar Covenant with himſelf, meerly out of preventing mercy, whereas thou mighteſt have been born among the uncircumciſed: it's no ſmall priviledge to be born of thoſe that are themſelves in Covenant with God.

(3) The people of God have exerciſed faith upon their parents Covenant, and have been able ſometimes in diſtreſs to plead that when they have had little to ſay for themſelves, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.1. when <hi>Moſes</hi> prays he ſays, <hi>Thou art my God, and my fathers God;</hi> and the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though they could ſay little for themſelves, for they were a wicked and diſobedient people, and their righteouſneſs as a filthy rag, yet they ſay, <hi>Remember the covenant that thou madeſt to Abraham, and the land that thou gaveſt unto Abraham thy friend for ever;</hi> and ſo <hi>David, Thy ſervant and the ſon of thy hand-maid.</hi> And <hi>Auſtin</hi> pleaded his happineſs in his good mother, he was the ſon of her tears and of her Covenant-intereſt, and

(2) To lay up conſtant Prayers for thoſe that they receive; and it's not a ſmall mercy for a man to have a ſtock going in the Churches Ship, and to have a daily and a continual intereſt in their Prayers; Chriſt gives an example of it, <hi>Math.</hi> 19.14, 15. <hi>He laid his hands upon them and bleſſed them;</hi>

                  <p>HAving ſpoken thus far of two general heads, (1) the Perſon that made the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and had the firſt great hand in it, and that was God, and therefore it's called Gods Covenant, and not mans, <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant between me and thee,</hi> (2) the perſons with whom this Covenant is made, and that in a threefold ſubordination; [1] <hi>with Chriſt as Mediator, as a publick perſon, as the ſecond</hi> Adam, [2] <hi>with Believers in him,</hi> [3] <hi>in them with all their ſeed:</hi> Let us now come to look into the nature of this Covenant more particularly, and examine the eſſentials thereof. There are three things that are ordinarily diſtinguiſhed by Divines, a <hi>Law,</hi> a <hi>Teſtament,</hi> and a <hi>Covenant;</hi> A <hi>Law</hi> depends upon the abſolute Soveraignty of the Law-giver, and requires ſubjection, whether the perſons commanded conſent to it or no; and ſo all the Laws of God do depend upon the abſolute Soveraignty of God, as he is a Law-giver, able to ſave and to deſtroy: A <hi>Teſtament</hi> is grounded only upon the Will of the Teſtator, bequeathing of ſuch Legacies freely without requiring the conſent of the party to whom they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed; but a <hi>Covenant</hi> differs from them both, in this, that it requires the conſent and agreement of both parties, and therein each party binds himſelf freely to the performance of ſeveral conditions each to other. <hi>Cocceius</hi> doth ground it upon that place <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. <hi>A Covenant eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes,</hi> and he defines it thus;<note place="margin">

                     <hi>It is a Law that God eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes upon Promiſes:</hi> and therefore implies two things, ſomething on Gods part, which is the promiſe, and ſomething on mans part, which is the duty, and unto both theſe conſent of parties is required; Gods conſent unto the promiſe, and mans conſent unto the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and therefore by a Synecdoche the name Covenant is applied unto both parts of theſe, and both of them are called the Covenant. (1) The Covenant is ſometimes put for the Promiſe of God, which is the Covenant on Gods part:<note place="margin">Exod. 34.10.</note> 
                     <hi>Behold I will make a Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all thy people, I will do marvels:</hi> the meaning is no more but <hi>voluntaria promiſſione me obſtringo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I bind my ſelf by a voluntary promiſe. This is my covenant with thee,</hi>

                     <hi>ſays the Lord, My Spirit that is put upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.19. <hi>All the heave-offering of the holy things, which the children of Iſrael offer unto the Lord, have I given thee and thy ſons by a ſtatute for ever, it it a covenant of ſalt for ever, before the Lord.</hi> It is ſpoken only of the free promiſe of God made unto <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto the Prieſhood. (2) The Covenant is ſometimes put for the command of God, in which he doth require a duty from man. <hi>Moſes</hi> was with the Lord in the Mount forty days and nights, and he writ upon the Tables <hi>the words of the Covenant,</hi>

                     <hi>the ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> and it's common in Scripture-acceptation, to put the command of God and the duty of man under the name of the Covenant of God. So that there are in the eſſentials of the Covenant two things, (1) there is the promiſe on Gods part, which is Gods part of the Covenant, (2) there is the duty on man's part in reference unto the command of God, there is mercy and duty, and mutual conſent of both.</p>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:52030:143"/>
                  <p>We ſhall begin with the Convenant on Gods part, that we may ſee what of his free grace he doth oblige and bind himſelf unto; though it's true, he is debtor to none, any further than his own free grace makes him ſo.<note place="margin">Deus promit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendo ſe debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torem fecit. <hi>Auſtin.</hi>
                     </note> Now Gods part of the Covenant conſiſts in promiſes and rewards, and mans part of the Covenant conſiſts in ſervices; and in theſe two are the eſſentials of the covenant, and theſe will be our three general heads to be ſpoken to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Gods part of the covenant doth conſiſt in promiſes; ſuch is the covenant that he made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> wherein he does promiſe to be a God unto him, and to his ſeed after him; and this will appear in four things. (1) Becauſe in Scripture we find the covenant and the promiſes to be put for one and the ſame thing: <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>To Abraham and his ſeed were the promiſes made; and this I ſay, that the covenant confirmed before of God in Chriſt, the law that was four hundred and thirty years after could not diſannul, or make the promiſe of none effect.</hi> And hence it is called the <hi>covenant of promiſe, Eph.</hi> 2.12. which though ſome of our Divines do put, and may be not unfitly, as a diſtinction of the covenant of Grace, into two branches,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ball</hi> of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant <hi>4.</hi> p. <hi>27.</hi>
                     </note> the covenant of promiſe, and the new covenant, taking this for the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with the Fathers before the exhibiting of Chriſt in the fleſh, who did only ſee the promiſes afar off, and ſaluted them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. and therefore they are called the <hi>children of the covenant and of the promiſe;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 3.25.</note> yet the truth is, ſo long as there is any one part of it unaccompliſhed, ſo far it will be the covenant of promiſe, and conſiſt in promiſes ſtill, till Gods people do come to Heaven, and receive the happineſs and the inheritance of the covenant, which the Lord has now promiſed to the Saints. (2) A people taken into cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God are ſaid to be intitled unto the promiſes, which before they were ſtrangers unto,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.4.</note> and could claim no intereſt in; when God took the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into covenant with himſelf, and they became unto him a peculiar people and treaſure of all the people of the earth, then unto them did belong <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the worſhip of God and the promiſes,</hi> which all the other Nations of the Earth could lay no claim unto; and upon this ground all thoſe that are confederates with God, and taken into covenant, they are called <hi>the coheirs of promiſe,</hi> becauſe they have a title unto all thoſe great things which God in covenant has ingaged himſelf to beſtow. (3) When the Lord doth perform any promiſe, he is then ſaid to keep his covenant, and to remember his covenant, to perform his mercy promiſed unto our Forefathers; when he did fulfil his promiſes he remembred for them his covenant: ſo that as when they do tranſgreſs his command, that being part of his covenant, they are ſaid to break covenant with God; ſo when the Lord does not perform his promiſe, he is ſaid to break the covenant,<note place="margin">Pſal. 89.39. Zac. 11.10.</note> and to make it void. (4) The end of the covenant is but to inherit the promiſes, all the Saints are ſaid to be the <hi>Sons of Abraham,</hi> becauſe they are taken into the ſame covenant with him, with whom God did eminently make the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and for this cauſe the children of the ſame covenant are called the <hi>Sons of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> and Heaven, being the ſame inheritance that <hi>Abraham</hi> had as the end of his covenant, and the ſame that all the Saints enter into, it's therefore called in reſpect of them, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams boſome,</hi> they ſit down with <hi>Abraham</hi> in the kingdom of God, that is, having the ſame reward of their covenant that <hi>Abraham</hi> had; and that's nothing but the promiſed inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, they do inherit the promiſes:<note place="margin">Heb. 6.12.</note> ſo that all the glory that the people of God have in Heaven, it's nothing elſe but the accompliſhment of promiſes, it's both a purchaſed and a promiſed poſſeſſion: it is true, that one ingredient of the covenant is <hi>Law,</hi> but that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto the covenant as it contains the rules of our ſervices, and the covenant on our part, and not to the covenant on Gods part; for to make a Covenant is ſimply an act of Grace, whereas to give a Law is ſimply an act of Soveraignty and abſolute Dominion.</p>
                  <p>Here my purpoſe is not to handle the Doctrine of the promiſes in the extent or full lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude thereof, but only ſpeak of it as it refers mainly unto the point in hand; Firſt we will conſider what a promiſe is, <hi>It is the declaration of the eternal purpoſe of God concerning good things to come, which he doth ingage his faithfulneſs freely through Chriſt, to beſtow upon his people.</hi>

It's true, we read of a promiſe made before the world began, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.2. but it was in reſpect of the covenant that paſſed between the Father and the Son, and could not be formally made unto the Saints, but is ſecret in his own thoughts and purpoſes; and theſe thoughts of God to us-ward, as they are innumerable, ſo they were exceeding delightful to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.5. <hi>How wonderful are thy works, and thy thoughts to us-ward,</hi> &amp;c. but the breaking forth of this purpoſe of God is ſeen in his promiſes.

It's the great ground of the prayer of Chriſt, and of his Angels and Saints in Heaven, for the Angels do pray, and ſo do the Saints in Heaven, the ſouls under the Altar cry,<note place="margin">Dan. 4.16, 17.

                  <p n="3">§. 3. The promiſes of God in Scripture are of two ſorts, ſome are <hi>abſolute,</hi> ſome <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,</hi> and the grounds of theſe diſtinctions of promiſes are theſe. 1. There is a twofold
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:52030:144"/> love of God unto the creature, (1) <hi>antecedent Love,</hi> that is ſet upon the creature, for love ſake and out of his own free choice and election;<note place="margin">Rom. 9.18.</note> 
                     <hi>he will have mercy on whom he will have mercy;</hi> and upon this are grounded all abſolute promiſes: (2) there is a <hi>conſequent Love,</hi> as the Lord delights to crown the acts of his own Love in the creature, having wrought his own image he doth love it, and delight in it, more than in all the reſt of the works of his hands, and this is the ground of all conditional promiſes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Abſolute Promiſes</hi> are not formally made unto us, though they be fulfilled in us, but unto Chriſt; for no promiſe can belong unto him that is not an heir of promiſe; and though a man be ſo in the Election of God, yet he is not actually ſo till he be united unto Chriſt; and therefore it is unto him that all the abſolute promiſes do belong. If we look upon man in a ſtate of Nature, ſo there are abſolute promiſes of grace for a mans converſion; but look upon a man in a ſtate of Grace, and ſo there are conditional pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that do belong unto him for his conſolation and ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In abſolute promiſes the creature is meerly <hi>paſſive,</hi> and there is no prerequired con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the creature for the accompliſhment of it; it's perfectly an act of Gods grace to the creature to promiſe him to be his God, to pardon his ſin, and take away his heart of ſtone; there is no concurrence of the endeavour of the creature in it; for all the works of God in this k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l are a new creation: but in conditional promiſes there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition prerequired in the creature, and there is an actual concurrence of the creature to their performance, without which God will never perform the condition; <hi>he that converts thee without thee, will not ſave thee without thee;</hi> we muſt be built as living ſtones in the Church of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is a double ſtate of Faith, a ſtate of <hi>Recumbency</hi> or <hi>Affiance,</hi> and a ſtate of <hi>Aſſurance;</hi> and the promiſes of the Goſpel are ſuited unto both theſe ſtates. A man that can ſee no grace in his own ſoul, he comes to the promiſe for grace, and reſolves to caſt himſelf upon it, he does <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e to Chriſt that he may have life, and caſts himſelf upon the promiſe, that his ſins may be pardoned: and the truth is, in this doth properly the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of faith in a mans firſt converſion lye, in leaving a mans ſoul with the promiſe, that he may receive grace and pardon; not in believing that Chriſt is mine, but in relying upon him, and giving up my ſelf to him. There is a kind of <hi>perſonal Application,</hi> and that is <hi>direct;</hi> and there is an <hi>axiomatical Application</hi> of faith, when the ſoul being in Chriſt, and having received grace, is able to ſee and to conclude its own intereſt. Unto faith of <hi>Recumbence</hi> the abſolute promiſes do fitly ſuit. But there is a ſtate of <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> when the ſoul looks into his own heart, and finds the image of Chriſt written there, and ſees promiſes made to a broken and a believing heart, one poor in ſpirit, and he finds the condition in himſelf, and now all the conditional promiſes come in with comfort to him, who before could taſte no ſweetneſs in them, becauſe he could not find in himſelf the condition.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There are two ways of aſſurance anſwerable to the twofold witneſs of it: there is a witneſs in Heaven, and there is a witneſs alſo in the heart. (1) There is an immediate teſtimony; <hi>Rejoyce in this, that your names are written in heaven,</hi> ſaith our Lord: again the Lord ſays to a man, <hi>Be of good chear thy ſins are forgiven thee, and thou art greatly beloved.</hi> Such immediate teſtimonies there have been given to the Saints; and ſurely the bowels of the Lord are not ſtraitned.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.7.</note> Thus there is a teſtimony of the Spirit that is diſtinct from the witneſs of water and blood; the Spirit is the ſeal in both, but in the one he is the ſeal of his <hi>Office,</hi> and in the other the ſeal of his <hi>Officers;</hi> a particular ſeal and a privy ſignet: in the one he teſtifies the love of all the perſons, and there is teſtified that his own love and the love of God is ſhed abroad in the heart, there is <hi>illuminatio quaedam è montibus aeternis, an illumination from the eternal mountains,</hi> as <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſpeaks. (2) There is an Aſſurance that comes from the witneſs of a mans own graces, <hi>the Spirit of God witneſſing with our ſpirits.</hi> Now the firſt aſſurance is in an abſolute promiſe, <hi>I am thy God, thou art greatly beloved, thy ſins are forgiven thee:</hi> and the latter kind of aſſurance is in a conditional pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, the Lord diſcovering to a man the ſigns of grace in his own ſoul, and the glorious works of the Spirit of Chriſt upon his inward man, conforming him to the image of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The great difference between the firſt and ſecond Covenant lay in this: the promiſes of the firſt Covenant were all of them conditional, being given unto grace received, and did ſuppoſe grace in the perſon to whom they were made; but there were no abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to give grace: that Covenant did ſuppoſe grace, but it did not give grace. But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, as there are promiſes of reward of grace received, ſo there are promiſes of giving grace, where there is no grace; and herein lies the great glory of the promiſes of the new Covenant, and the grace of them, it gives grace, and then it crowns grace; and therefore they are ſaid to be better promiſes.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <pb n="246" facs="tcp:52030:145"/>7. Abſolute promiſes have their degrees of accompliſhment as well as conditional; though a man has a right to them all at once, yet the Lord doth perform them by degrees to us; there is no promiſe that is fully and perfectly accompliſhed till we come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; our juſtification is not perfect till then; our iniquities are then perfectly blotted out, when the time of refreſhment ſhall come; then a man ſhall be perfectly acquitted from all ſin for ever, and have an abſolute ſentence paſt upon him by God, and in his own ſoul for ever. As the Lord did give his Son by degrees, and yet there is a further giving of him, when he that is gone before ſhall come again, and fetch you; alſo there are degrees of giving of the Spirit, and there is yet a further degree to come, when <hi>the weak ſhall be as David;</hi> ſo the Lord will be your God hereafter more eminently than he has been, in giving you not only grace, but glory. Now as the Lord doth take up and poſſeſs the ſoul to himſelf as his habitation, ſo he does more and more become a God to that ſoul, who is never perfected till he come to glory, till he enjoy him as he is.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Get a ſtrong faith; for it was by faith that they did attain the promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.33. and it muſt be ſuch a faith as muſt ſtay the heart, and fix the eye upon the promiſe, and thereby ſupport it under all the ſeeming oppoſitions and improbabilities or impoſſibilities unto an eye of reaſon, or an arm of fleſh: it muſt cauſe a man to cloſe his eyes againſt them all, in the matter of juſtification: there is in faith an <hi>excluſive reſolution</hi> againſt all other ways and means of righteouſneſs whatſoever; ſo there is in this alſo againſt all things that from ſenſe and reaſon may be offered or pretended to the ſoul, to weaken the power of the promiſe of God therein.<note place="margin">Rom. 4.19, 20.</note> In <hi>Abraham</hi> there was enough that he might have taken in to have diſcouraged him, but yet <gap reason="foreign">

God had promiſed his people a deliverance, but they ſay our bones are dry, and our hope is paſt,<note place="margin">Ezech. 37.11.12.</note> we have no more reaſon to expect the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch a promiſe, than that we ſhould ſee dry bones revive and ariſe out of their graves. And the people of God have had their hearts always to fail them, when they have looked off from the promiſe; as <hi>Peter</hi> when the wind aroſe, and he begins to ſink, he crys out, <hi>Lord ſave me;</hi> and <hi>Martha</hi> ſaith, <hi>By this time he ſtinketh;</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſay, <hi>The ſons of Anak are there,</hi> &amp;c. As whenſoever the people of God begin to turn away their eyes from the holy commandment, then their hearts fail them in point of duty; ſo it is when they look off from the holy promiſe, then their heart fails them in matter of faith, and they caſt away their confidence; for every promiſe carries with it an obligation laid upon the power of God to accompliſh it: our faith gives us a title to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and the promiſe binds the omnipotence of God for its accompliſhment; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's ſaid, <hi>They ſtopped the mouths of lyons, and quencht the violence of the fire,</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. Be much in prayer, for the promiſe is a kind of a debt, and therefore it's ſaid when God doth perform any promiſe, <hi>reddit debita nulli debens,</hi> &amp;c. and it's prayer that puts this bond in ſuit before the Throne of Grace.<note place="margin">Jer. 29.10, 12.</note> After ſeventy years are accompliſhed in

                     <hi>Babylon,</hi> I will viſit you, and perform my good word towards you, in cauſing you to return unto this place; then ſhall you call upon me, and pray to me, and I will hear you: and this was the very courſe that <hi>Daniel</hi> took;<note place="margin">Dan. 9.1, 2.</note> for we can expect nothing from God in mercy that we do not obtain by prayer; he leads his people into their own land by ſupplications. In the conſolations that we receive from God, he ſpeaks to our hearts, and in the ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that we put up unto God, we ſpeak unto his heart: and the grounds are theſe, why God will have all promiſes to be nothing elſe but the returns of prayer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That hereby we may teſtifie that it's the will of God that we eye in the mercy, and not our own will; for it's whatſoever we ask according to his will he hears us. There is a natural and a carnal deſire of mercies, when it's a mans own will that puts him upon it: and there is a ſpiritual and holy deſire of mercies, and that is when a man has an eye unto Gods will in the promiſe to beſtow them, as well as to his own neceſſity that requires them.<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> Hence there is a double importunity in prayer, as <hi>Luk</hi> 11.8. a holy kind of impudency that they will in no wiſe be put off, there's a being ſtirred up by the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of neceſſity,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 7.14.</note> and a deſire of the fleſh to attain the thing, and ſo men howl for corn, wine, and oyl, but they are but the crys of beaſts, and not of Saints, and ſo men ask amiſs, and attain not, as it is in <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5. But there is an importunity that is grounded upon the will of God and upon the promiſe, and the ſoul earneſtly deſires it, becauſe he ſees it's agreeable unto the will of God that has promiſed it, it's not the love of the thing that is ſo much the ground of his importunity, as ſeeing the will of God in the promiſe, and for this cauſe the Lord will make the accompliſhment of all promiſes to be the only returns of prayers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That hereby we may know, that his mercy is free in beſtowing of it; and that though God has promiſed it in a way of mercy, yet there is no way for us to attain it but in a way of duty, <hi>to perform the promiſe is Gods part, and to preſs God with his promiſe is our part.</hi> I will do it for you, ſays tne Lord, yet I will be inquired of by you, that I may do it for you; ask and you ſhall receive, knock and it ſhall be opened: and there is no way that ever any creature could attain any thing of God but this way. Upon this very ground Chriſt himſelf, if he will attain from God, he muſt ask; and ſo 'tis with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and ſo 'tis with the Saints in Heaven,<note place="margin">Dan. 4.17.</note> they cry, How long Lord? How much more is it to be with duſt and aſhes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the Lord may honour his own Ordinance, and teſtifie how much he doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the worſhip of a creature, and that thereby he might make it a double mercy. For ungodly men to receive bleſſings as a fruit of Providence unto them, it comes always ſingle, that is, in the thing only; but unto a godly man, that has it as a fruit of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, it's always a double mercy, mercy in the thing, and mercy to the man, not only an accompliſhment of Gods promiſes, but the return of the mans prayers, the exerciſe of Gods faithfulneſs unto us, and of our graces towards God; and there are no mercies ſo ſweet as thoſe that come in with the exerciſe of grace in the attaining of them: <hi>Deum orationibus ambiamus, coelum tundimus, &amp; miſericordiam extorquemus,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſays of the power of the Saints prayers, becauſe of his delight in the exerciſe of their graces. And there is no duty wherein the graces of the Saints do act with more life and power than they do in prayer: there is <hi>magna conjunctio,</hi> a great concurrence of grace in them, as we ſee it in <hi>Abraham</hi> in his prayer, what ſtrong acts of grace he puts forth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. The nearer the ſoul draws to God the fountain of its life, the more lively it works, and moves the ſwifter, the nearer the centre; and there is no duty in which the ſoul draws nearer to God, than it doth in prayer, and hath more immediate communion with him, than when he is upon his knees before the Throne of grace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And laſtly, the way to attain promiſes is a patient waiting for them till the Lords time come; for it's true of promiſes as it is of prophecies, though the viſion be for an appointed time, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.3. yet wait for it, for it will come and will not tarry. It's a ſpeech like unto that in <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.7, 8. though he bear long with them, yet he will avenge them ſpeedily: it may tarry long in reſpect of the time prefixed by us, and may ſeem long to us, but it ſhall not be long when the time comes that is appointed by God. The Lord commonly does in the anſwering of prayers, as he does in the fulfilling of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, it's a great while before the Prophecy ſeems to ſpeak, or to give any hope of its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment, as it was in the deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon;</hi> but yet when once it begins but to dawn its day, immediately, in a manner, it ſtrangely and ſuddenly breaks forth, that the Saints of God can ſcarce believe their own eyes, they are like unto them that dream. And ſo it is in the return of their prayers alſo, as in the calling of the Jews, they are as dry bones, and they are ſcattered here and there all the world over; but the bones ſhall come together, and it ſhall be ſo ſuddenly done, that the Lord ſaith, A Nation
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:52030:146"/> ſhall be born at once, and before <hi>Sion</hi> travelled ſhe brought forth; and ſo it is in the anſwer of Prayers, as it was with <hi>Elijah,</hi> he prayed ſeven times, and his ſervant looked and there was nothing, and yet he continued praying, at laſt there appeared a Cloud like unto a mans hand, and by and by the Heavens were covered over with Clouds, and then the rain fell: when it begins once to appear that the Clouds do break away a little, the Lord doth ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haſten the work, and there is a glorious concurrence and falling in of all cauſes to its accompliſhment; there is a time of the Promiſe's accompliſhment,<note place="margin">Acts 7.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now the grounds to aſſure the Soul thereof are theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The faithfulneſs of God: the Promiſes are therefore confirmed by an Oath, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17. that by two immutable things, wherein it's impoſſible for God to lye, we might have ſtrong Conſolation, <hi>Quid eſt Dei juratio, niſi promiſſi confirmatio,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Covenant made with Chriſt was confirmed by an Oath, and upon that the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it is mainly put, for upon him the Promiſes do mainly depend; all the Promiſes are in him Yea, and Amen, and upon that it's put, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. the promiſe of Eternal Life,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.20.</note> which God that cannot lie has promiſed before the world began: To whom was this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made before the world began? a purpoſe might be in his own breaſt, but a promiſe muſt be to another; and God cannot lye unto Chriſt, he will not ſurely deceive him; the Son has been faithful to him in all the parts of the Covenant, and therefore ſurely the Lord will be faithful unto Chriſt. The Covenanr is confirmed by a double Oath, one to us,<note place="margin">Hebr. 6.17. Pſal. 110.4.</note> and the other to Chriſt; the Lord has ſworn and he will not repent: He was not made a Prieſt without an Oath, therefore the New Covenant is call'd the Word of the Oath, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.28.<note place="margin">

                  <p n="4">4. The experiences of all the Saints and thy own experiments: the Saints all of them have known the Lord by his name Jehovah, they all of them have by faith and patience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited the promiſes; but in a ſpecial manner a mans own experience, from which he may argue, God that delivered me from out of the mouth of the Lyon and the Bear, will alſo deliver me from this <hi>Goliah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.17.</note> &amp;c. and God has delivered me, and he will deliver me from every evil work. A man ſhould treaſure up every experiment as an aſſurance of the ſame faithfulneſs in the ſame extremity, and thereby ſet to his ſeal that God is true. A great part of the Communion of Saints ſhould be in this, in imparting their experiments one to another, and thereby honour the faithfulneſs of God: and as it is our duty here on earth, and our comfort, ſo it ſhall be a great part of a mans happineſs in Heaven, when a man ſhall tell ſtories of Gods mercies and <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> unto all Eternity.</p>
                  <p>But ſays the Soul, I may ſtay long for this promiſe to be accompliſhed; for God has ſet no time in his Word when it ſhall be, and therefore the Saints have waited till their eyes have failed,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>. Heb. 10.37.</note> till the promiſe have come to the birth: the Apoſtle ſays it's not long, 'tis but a little while. Oh therefore ſet faith on work, and that looks as God looks, to whom a thouſand years are as but one day; that which ſeems long to ſenſe, is but ſhort unto faith: conſider much the waiting and all the long-ſuffering of God for thee, before thou didſt take hold of his grace in Chriſt Jeſus, and ſhall not we wait upon a great God that could have been, and was happy without us, and needed none of our ſervices, we that are but as a worm, and unprofitable to him in whatever we can do?</p>
                  <p>But there are three things that a Soul may know by, that the accompliſhment of the promiſe is at hand.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When the extremity increaſes, for the time of the promiſe is near, when the tasks are doubled, for his name will always be known to be a God ſeen in the Mount: when all is deſperate, and you know not what to do, then look for God to come in to your help.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When God does raiſe up in the ſoul an earneſt expectation of the mercy, and a man begins to ſet himſelf to ſeek the Lord with more earneſtneſs for it, then it's a ſign it is near at hand. When Chriſt was to come in the fleſh, there were thoſe that waited for the conſolation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and had ſpecial expectations raiſed up in them for his coming. And ſo it was with <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 9.1.</note> when he underſtood by books the time of <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> Captivity drew to an end, then he ſets himſelf to prayer: for thoſe expectations and enlargements of the heart are from God, and ſhall be anſwered.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When in the middle of all a mans ſeeking, his heart is brought into a quiet and an humble frame, and he is contented to ſubmit to the will of God, when a mans heart is brought to a holy indifference, to be contented with God alone; as <hi>David</hi> was never nearer the Kingdom,<note place="margin">Bernard.</note> than when his heart was as a weaned child, <hi>Vis me conſtituere ovium paſtorem, aut regem populorum, ecce paratum eſt cor meum.</hi> When the ſoul is in ſuch a frame, he may expect the promiſe ſhall not be long delayed to him.</p>

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:52030:147"/> of <hi>things.</hi> [1] Promiſes of <hi>things</hi> that are abſolute and real; and of theſe are chiefly four.

                     <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi> And there is a further diſcovery of the promiſe in <hi>Eſa.</hi> 44.3. <hi>I will pour my Spirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing upon thy off-ſpring.</hi> And ſo <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28. <hi>I will pour out of my Spirit upon all fleſh.</hi> So that theſe three are the great perſonal Promiſes of the Goſpel, and in theſe doth the main grace of the new Covenant lye.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As for the nature of perſonal Promiſes, they do import a gracious propriety in the perſons, which God doth by Covenant make over unto the creature. The end of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes is to give a <hi>propriety;</hi> and we know that a propriety amongſt the creatures is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> when a man doth claim ſuch a thing as his own, and has a power to uſe it, and diſpoſe of it in a lawful way for his own benefit and advantage, as it ſeemeth good to him: ſo that propriety as it were puts the thing into the mans hand to do with it what he pleaſeth, to make improvement and advantage of it, that it may be for his own accommodation, he may do what he liſt with his own, &amp;c. As if a man hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in Lands or Houſes, he may either ſell, or let, or give, or leave, or live upon them as he pleaſeth. Now as there is a <hi>real propriety</hi> that reſpects things, ſo there is a <hi>perſonal propriety</hi> that reſpects perſons, which is grounded either in <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>voluntary</hi> relations; as a Father has a propriety in his Son, and the Son in the Father, and the Husband in the Wife, and the Wife in the Husband, the Prince in the People, and the People in their Prince: and the intent of perſonal propriety is the ſame in its kind with that which is real, that every perſon that has ſuch a propriety in another, ſhould enjoy all benefits and advantages, as they could in a way of equity expect or deſire to do: as the husband that hath a propriety in the wife, if there were no ſinful defects in the perſons that are ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated, ſhould receive from her all manner of help and aſſiſtance, as if he himſelf were the wife; and his wife receive from her husband all that kindneſs and ſupport, as if ſhe were the husband, and as if all were in her own power to uſe. And ſo it is in perſonal promiſes, the intent of them is to make over the perſons, that when the Lord ſays, <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> the meaning is, whatſoever is in me as a God, ſhall be truly thine, my infinite power, my infinite wiſdom, and grace and mercy, all ſhall be thine, that the ſoul may lawfully lay claim to it, and confidently expect it of him, and that as truly, as if the creature it ſelf had infinite power, and wiſdom, and mercy, and all in his own hands. So it is in giving the perſon of the Son, that we ſhould have a propriety and an intereſt in him as our Brother, our Husband, our Head; and whatever is in him, whether of grace or merit, ſhall be as truly ours, as it is his, and as truly laid out for us, as if we had it all inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in our ſelves: And ſo it is in giving the Spirit, it is a propriety in the perſon: ſo that the Spirit for conviction, for converſion, for ſanctification, for renovation, for direction, and for conſolation, doth as truly improve theſe for us, as if they were our own, and as if they were inherent in us, or we could uſe and exerciſe them according to our own pleaſure: and they are theſe perſonal promiſes of the Covenant that do intitle the ſoul to ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the perſons.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The grounds of them, <hi>why muſt the ſecond Covenant have perſonal promiſes?</hi> The grounds of it are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Man in his Fall had wholly loſt God, and therefore he is ſaid <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. <hi>to be without God in the world,</hi> one that had no relation to him, one that had no intereſt in him. It's true,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:52030:148"/> that <hi>Adam</hi> before his Fall had a natural propriety in God, both as his Creator, and as his Father,<note place="margin">Luc. 3. <hi>ult.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Adam</hi> was the <hi>Son of God;</hi> and ſo it's true of the Angels, they are called his <hi>Sons,</hi> becauſe they did bear his Image,<note place="margin">Job 1.6.</note> which no other Creature did; but after his Fall all Right unto God was forfeited, and man could not look upon him in any relation, either as a Creature or as a Son, for now he is not the Creature that God made him, <hi>your ſpot is not the ſpot of his children,</hi> for you bear not his Image or Similitude. Now in the ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the Soul has his relation unto God, and propriety in God that was his happineſs in his Creation; and if ever he be made happy again, his propriety unto God muſt be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Therefore that is the purpoſe and intendment in the Second Covenant, to reſtore that which is loſt by the breach of the firſt Covenant; and our great loſs by the Fall was the loſs of God, and a propriety in him; though we alſo loſt the Creatures, and forfeited our lives and ſouls, loſt our ſelves, yet our great loſs was the loſs of God; and if the Lord ſhould have reſtored unto Man the inheritance of the Creatures again, yet all this would never have repaired his loſs, unleſs he had found out a way for to make over himſelf again.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Without this the Creature could never be happy; for wherein doth happineſs conſiſt, but in theſe two things? There muſt be <hi>Proportion</hi> and <hi>Propriety;</hi> a good that muſt fill up all the deſires of the Soul, and a man muſt have an intereſt in it: Now if the Lord ſhould give a man all the Creatures, they are not a proportionable good, becauſe they are finite; and they are without Propriety in them, they are not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>a proper good;</hi> it will be therefore another mans, and may remain unto another. And though it is true, that God is a proportionable good, as he is alſo unto all, even the Devils, and damned Spirits, ſo as to make them happy, for he is an infinite good; yet they cannot be made happy by him, becauſe they have no <hi>propriety</hi> in him: theſe two muſt concur to the happineſs of the Creature. Now if when Man had fallen, God ſhould have reſtored him unto his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the Creatures again, yet they could never have made him happy, becauſe they wanted theſe two ingredients; his happineſs therefore conſiſts <hi>mainly, radically,</hi> and <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally</hi> in his perſonal intereſt and propriety; and there was no way left to make him happy, the former way being made void, but by a free and a gracious promiſe. God by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Gift made himſelf freely over to him, that is, all the perſons in the Trinity unto the Creature for his happineſs; and therefore we may ſee, that was the great intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Goſpel of Grace; <hi>for that which is ultimum in executione, laſt in execution, is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum in intentione, firſt in intention:</hi> The higheſt happineſs of Man in Glory is the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, when God is all in all to him; and the full fruition of Chriſt, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; for therein is the laſt and great accompliſhment of all theſe perſonal promiſes, as we ſhall ſee afterwards: now in this conſiſting the happineſs of man, this was the great and firſt intendment of the Goſpel, to make over God to him in all the perſons for his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt advancement and perfection.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Theſe Promiſes are the grounds of our Union with all the perſons in the Trinity. That there is ſuch a Union between Chriſt and the Soul is plain, and that it is not only unto Chriſt as Man, but unto Chriſt as God-man; and there is a Union that we have after a ſort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the Godhead of Chriſt, and there is a Union with the Spirit, which alſo is clear, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 6.17. <hi>He that is joyned unto the Lord is one Spirit;</hi> and by this means there is a Union alſo with the Father, <hi>John</hi> 17.21. <hi>I would that they might be one as we are one; not only one in themſelves, but one with us,</hi> after a reſemblance of that unſpeakable Union that is between the Father and the Son; and therefore God is ſaid <hi>to dwell in us,</hi> 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 6.16. we are ſaid <hi>to dwell in him,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.16. the Church is ſaid <hi>to be in God,</hi> and the Faithful, <hi>to be in Christ Jeſus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 1.</note> and <hi>to work in God, John</hi> 3.21. moſt of their works are wrought in God; and this Union is begun in this Life, and ſo far as it is wanting, ſo far is the Creature imperfect; it's the perfection of this Union in Heaven that is the full happineſs and perfection of the Creature; and it's by vertue of theſe promiſes, that this Union between God and the Creature is begun; and Heaven, that is the perfection of this Union, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the accompliſhment of theſe promiſes: the Promiſe in the fulneſs of it makes Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is in this Union that the foundation is laid of all Communion: Communion is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly of perſons, though it be in things; Men can with things have no fellowſhip, this muſt be properly between perſons;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.3.</note> 
                     <hi>Our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with the Son Jeſus Christ:</hi> and there is a fellowſhip of the Spirit alſo: now all fellowſhip is grounded in Union; and the very Communion of Saints that they have with all the perſons, doth prove, that they have a Union with them alſo. Now it's an intereſt you ſee in the perſon that's the ground of fellowſhip; as the Covenant of Grace is a Covenant of Friendſhip, and it's likened to a Marriage Covenant. Now all matrimonial Communion is grounded upon the intereſt that they have in the perſon each of other; ſo that the Husband is not his own, and the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:52030:148"/> Wife is not her own; they have by their own conſent freely made over the intereſt and propriety of themſelves unto each other, that now they are not at their own diſpoſe, wthout the mutual conſent each of other: and ſo it's in this alſo; it's our Union with the perſon, that is the ground of our Communion; and all our perſonal intereſt in any of the perſons is grounded upon theſe perſonal promiſes, by which the perſons are made over to the Saints; and it is in theſe perſonal promiſes, that the Glory of the ſecond Covenant does conſiſt; it's ſaid <hi>to be eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hebr. 8.</note> The firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant did promiſe Life and Happineſs, which could not be without God, and the injoyment of God; for the Life promiſed muſt be anſwerable to the death threatned, which is an eternal ſeparation from God, and from all Communion with him, in Hell; therefore the Life promiſed muſt be a fruition of God, in all ways of Communion, in Heaven: But yet there is ſomething more in theſe particular promiſes of the Goſpel Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It's true, that <hi>Adam</hi> had a perſonal intereſt in God, but yet not ſuch an intereſt as the Saints now have; for the Lord was a God to <hi>Adam</hi> to reward him perſevering in ways of obedience here, and to be himſelf his reward in Heaven; but it was but while he continued in ways of obedience, God was not made over to him, therefore he did not ſay, <hi>I will make over to thee my Mercy to pardon thee, if thou ſinnest, and my Grace to heal thee:</hi> but there is ſomething of God made over in the perſonal promiſes of the Goſpel that never ſaw light before, and that is Mercy and Grace, which is the Glory of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, an Attribute that was never known but under the ſecond Covenant. And as all Gods Attributes were not made known to <hi>Adam</hi> by his perſonal intereſt, ſo neither were all the perſons unto thoſe perfect, high and compleat ends, that now they are unto the Heirs of Promiſe. The Lord did give <hi>Adam</hi> an intereſt in his Son, but not his Son to take the Nature of <hi>Adam,</hi> to be made lower than the Angels for the ſuffering of death: He gave him alſo an intereſt in his Spirit, but not to heal his corruption, and to perfect his Graces, or help his infirmities, or be an Advocate to plead his Cauſe before God, and his own Soul alſo; for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, alſo ſignifies an <hi>Advocate,</hi> as well as a <hi>Comforter:</hi> Chriſt is an Advocate without us, and the Spirit within us, inabling us to plead for our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Throne. Now in theſe reſpects, though <hi>Adam</hi> had perſonal promiſes, yet theſe of the Goſpel are now more glorious, and of a higher nature, and of a larger extent, and therefore they are <hi>better promiſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The greateſt Gift that ever God did beſtow upon a Creature is a Perſon, and therefore the giving of Chriſt is call'd by way of excellency, <hi>The gift of God:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 4.10.</note> 
                     <hi>If thou kneweſt the gift of God:</hi> And <hi>unto us a Son is given.</hi> It was a great gift that the Lord ſhould give to <hi>Adam</hi> the Lordſhip of the whole world, the inheritance of all the Creatures: but there is no excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in Creatures in compariſon of the glorious perſons in the Trinity. Anſwerable to the excellency of the thing given, we do rightly value the gift; and anſwerable unto the gift of his Son, we may alſo conclude of the Father and the Spirit; for the gift of the Son is upon that ground ſo great, becauſe he that has once attain'd an intereſt in the Son, the whole God-head is become his.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All the intereſt that a Soul has in the bleſſings of God, and benefits by him, have their foundation in our intereſt and propriety in the perſons themſelves; they are made over to us by theſe perſonal promiſes; and a man can have no more benefit by God, than he has intereſt in him: as the Pſalmiſt having ſpoken of all the benefits and bleſſings that they have by God, he comes at laſt to ſhew the title and the conveyance of them all,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal. 144.</hi> ver. the last.</note> and that is, <hi>Happy is the people whoſe God is Jehovah.</hi> The ground of all our benefits by Chriſt, is our Union with him, and the intendment of Union is Communication; and till a man become one with him, he can ſavingly have no benefit by him; as 'tis ſaid,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.22.</note> 
                     <hi>All things are yours, and you are Chriſts:</hi> it's your intereſt in his perſon, that gives you a title to his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance: as the Wife can have no claim to the eſtate and the honours of her Husband, but by her Union with him, and intereſt in his perſon; and anſwerable unto mens intereſt in perſons, ſuch is their title unto benefits by them; and they that have no intereſt in God, can have no title to any of the bleſſings of God; and therefore the fundamental promiſes and mercies are thoſe that are perſonal; <hi>He that hath the Son hath life:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.12.</note> there is no life from the Son, but by Union with him, <hi>you muſt eat his fleſh and drink his blood,</hi> which are terms of Union, if ever you hope for everlaſting life by him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. From our intereſt in the Perſons, the perſonal promiſes give us boldneſs, and acceſs to him; <hi>we have,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>boldneſs and acceſs</hi> to come to God by Chriſt.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3.12.</note> Now a Child comes to the Father with boldneſs, becauſe he has an intereſt in his perſon as a Father; and a Wife has acceſs unto her Husband with boldneſs, becauſe ſhe has an intereſt in him; whereas all ungodly men are ſtrangers to God, and therefore cannot ingage their hearts to draw near to him, for they have no intereſt in him, and therefore muſt ſtand without and can have no acceſs.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="254" facs="tcp:52030:149"/>5. The great promiſes to Chriſt as Mediator lye in this, that he has an intereſt in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and by perſonal promiſes they are made over to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.26. <hi>He ſhall call me my Father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 16.5.</note> 
                     <hi>my God;</hi> and this Chriſt glories in, <hi>the Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup;</hi> and it is this Chriſt takes hold of in his deſertion, <hi>my God, my God;</hi> that high ſpeech of Faith taking hold of theſe perſonal promiſes. It's a glorious inheritance that God has given to Chriſt, for he hath made him heir of all things: but yet his inheritance in all the Creatures is nothing in compariſon of the inheritance he has in the Lord, as he is his God,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.35.</note> and in the Spirit, which is therefore called the Spirit of Chriſt, becauſe <hi>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not the ſpirit by meaſure.</hi> As the great delights of the God-head from everlaſting were in the perſons one of another,<note place="margin">Prov. 8.30.</note> 
                     <hi>I was by him as one brought up with him, and I was his delight daily:</hi> ſo the great delight of Chriſt is in his intereſt in the perſon of the Father. He has alſo a great delight in the Saints, becauſe they are his Seed, and his Spouſe, and therefore <hi>he doth rejoyce over them as a Bridegroom over his Bride:</hi> but yet the main delight of Chriſt as Mediator, doth lye in his intereſt in the perſon of the Father, and of the Spirit; and as God made over his perſon firſt unto Chriſt by the Covenant of Redemption, ſo by that Covenant in him he made it over unto us, for he is Chriſts Father and our Father, he is Chriſts God and he is our God;<note place="margin">Joh. 20.17.</note> 
                     <hi>I aſcend to my Father and your Father, my God and your God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The main comfort of a Chriſtian comes in from perſonal relations of the Covenant, and they are all of them grounded in perſonal promiſes. He is our Father and our Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and our Friend, and all of theſe are perſonal relations, and ſpeak an intereſt in the perſon; and the great ſupport of Faith in the worſt times lyes in this, as we ſee in the Church, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63. <hi>doubtleſs thou art our Father:</hi> When the Lord was diſpleaſed with them, and had hid his face, and poured upon them ſpiritual judgments, hardned their hearts from his fear, and variety of temporal judgments; for the Adverſary had trodden down their Sanctuary: yet now when they have nothing elſe to lay hold of, it is upon a perſonal relation that they pitch, <hi>doubtleſs thou art our Father;</hi> and it's according to our relation to his perſon, that the Lord exhorts us to come to him: All our Prayers when we pray, is <hi>Our Father,</hi> and the ſpirit teacheth us to come unto him as our Father; ſo in all our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes unto God, he teacheth us to cry <hi>Abba Father;</hi> and ſo the Saints in Scripture, <hi>O Lord thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Hence comes that glorious communication of properties that is between God and the Saints; That as Divines do obſerve, by reaſon of the hypoſtatical Union, there is a communication of properties, that what is done by the humane nature is attributed unto the perſons, and the blood of the humane nature is called <hi>the blood of God,</hi> Acts 20.28. and <hi>God is ſaid to be received up to glory,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. and Chriſt is called the Son of God, which is proper only to the Divine Nature,<note place="margin">Luk. 1.35.</note> and the Humane Nature being taken into the ſame perſon, it comes under the ſame filiation; for the rule of the School-men is, <hi>filiatio est ſuppoſiti, filiation is of a perſon;</hi> the Son-ſhip belongs and relates unto the perſon, and not unto the nature: ſo from our Union with Chriſts perſon ariſe thoſe ſtrange communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations which ſome obſerve, the Lord calling himſelf by the name of a Creature, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.6. <hi>This is the generation of them that ſeek him; that ſeek thy face O Jacob:</hi> and that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and which ſome ſay is an incommunicable name of God <hi>Jehovah,</hi> yet it is ſaid to be attributed to the Creature, through his intereſt in the perſon of God, it's the name of Chriſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6. <hi>And in his days Judah ſhall be ſaved, and Iſrael ſhall dwell ſafely, and this is his name whereby he ſhall be called The Lord our righteouſneſs:</hi> and this name is alſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Church, <hi>Jer.</hi> 38.16. <hi>And in thoſe days ſhall Judah be ſaved, and Jeruſalem ſhall dwell ſafely, and this is the name wherewith ſhe ſhall be called The Lord our Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. and all this flows from intereſt in the perſon through perſonal promiſes.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Our intereſt in the perſons is always the ſame, and varies not, though the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are very various; and there is no Saint of God but doth find changes of the right hand of the moſt High, though the Lord in himſelf changes not: Sometime he lifts up the light of his countenance, and ſometimes he hides his face; but yet in the middle of all this here is the comfort of the Saints, the Lord is ſtill their God, and they have an intereſt in him. And ſo did Chriſt himſelf find a change of diſpenſations, there was <hi>ſubſtractio viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis, a ſubſtraction of viſion,</hi> but yet not <hi>unionis, of union:</hi> and when the Lord hid his face from him, then Chriſt flyes to a perſonal promiſe, and in that he looks upon God, when he could look upon him no other way, <hi>my God, my God,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo doth the Church, <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thou art our Father.</hi> And there is a ſpecial Art and Myſtery that the people of God have learned, when they are in the deepeſt deſertions to recover themſelves out of it, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. there the Church falls in love with the perſon of Chriſt, and looks upon her own intereſt in him, and then ſhe breaks out, <hi>this is my beloved, and this is my friend,</hi> and this recovers
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:52030:149"/> her again, ſo that ſhe glories in Chriſts intereſt in her, and hers in him, <hi>I am my beloveds, and my beloved is mine;</hi> the comfort of the Saints in their worſt eſtate is, that God has an intereſt in their perſons, <hi>I am thine, O ſave me,</hi> may every Saint of God ſay; and ſo they alſo have an intereſt in the perſon of God, <hi>this God is our God for ever,</hi> and ever:<note place="margin">Pſal. 48.14.</note> if there be never ſo great Changes or Diſpenſations, yet our relation unto the perſon is ſtill the ſame, and therefore ſo ſhould our claim be.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The higheſt objects of Faith are Perſons; for there is a three-fold object of Faith: (1.) <hi>Primarium, primary,</hi> and that is all Divine Truth: (2.) <hi>Mediatum, mediate,</hi> that is Chriſt as Mediator: (3.) <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltimatum, ultimate,</hi> for through Chriſt we believe in God,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.21.</note> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ultimate and the higheſt object of Faith is a Perſon: <hi>Objectum fidei eſt jus incomplexum, the object of faith is an incomplex right.</hi> Now that which is the higheſt object of Faith, that is the moſt perfect, in which only Faith can reſt, and therefore muſt be the greateſt ground of Hope, and Love, as that wherein our happineſs doth ultimately conſiſt.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The higheſt act of Gods Love to us, is, in accepting our perſons. Electing Love was ſet upon the perſon, and in Chriſt he doth accept our perſons, and has reſpect unto them; therefore if he reſpect our perſons ſo highly, being made over to him in Covenant, how much more ſhould we ſet a high price upon his excellent perſon, being made over to us in Covenant? It is his Love unto our perſons, that doth incline his heart to accept our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and reward them, and to beſtow all good things upon us: and ſo ſhould our Love unto the perſon of God be, that which ſhould ſweeten all his benefits towards us: he has not this Treaſure only, but he has the root alſo upon which it grows;<note place="margin">Revel. 21.6.</note> 
                     <hi>He ſhall inherit all things, I will be his God;</hi> and it is much more than all the Creatures can be to him, for he ſhall receive a hundred fold more in this life; it is not to be underſtood <hi>formalitèr, formally, ſed eminentèr, but eminently,</hi> that is, they ſhall have all made up in God that the Creatures could ſupply, if they were a hundred times multiply'd; God ſhall be all in all to them, ſo that they can complain of no want, for the Lord is their God.</p>

Arian.</hi> there is not any ſo deſperate an Opinion, that ſtrikes more at the root of all Religion, than this doth: all Hereſie is the ſmoak that ariſes out of the bottomleſs pit, and it is commonly vented by ſome Star that falls from Heaven, ſome Man Eminent in the Church, and he making an Apoſtaſie and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from the Truth, the Key of the bottomleſs pit is given him in judgment: a Key is <hi>poteſtatis ſymbolum, a ſymbol of power,</hi> as we know, and unto one man it's given as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Mercy, and unto another it's given as a ſpecial Judgment;<note place="margin">Revel. 20.1.</note> to the one it's given to bind Satan, and to the other to let out his ſmoak; and wo to the man to whom ſuch a power is given, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.1. Satan is ready enough to vent it upon all occaſions, but he cannot do it himſelf, but it muſt be by Inſtruments; as the Devil caſts men into priſon by Inſtruments;<note place="margin">Revel. 2.10.</note> now when he meets with fit Inſtruments for his work, and God in judgement gives them over unto an efficacy of deceit, that they do vent the Doctrines of Hell, the depths of Satan, then they do receive in judgement <hi>the Key of the bottomleſs pit to open it,</hi> that the ſmoak of it may be let forth, and the world receive its vent, which before was ſhut up in Hell, in the hearts of the Devils only, but now it is let forth to over-ſpread the Earth, and thereby the Sun and the Air is darkned; (ſo all the Truths of God are expreſſed) it's darkned as to all ſpiritual light, for that Satan doth aim at. Some do apply this to the Doctrines of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and ſome unto ſeveral abominations of that Idolatry that brake forth in the Weſt about that time, as <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> underſtands it of both. And out of the ſmoak came Locuſts upon the Earth: by Locuſts in Scripture two things are commonly intended; (1.) That they are a devouring Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and are therefore threatned as a judgement, that they ſhould ſeize upon all, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and devour all: (2.) They do go by great troops,<note place="margin">Joel 1.</note> and ſtrangely over-ſpread the Earth whereſoever they come; and this ſome do underſtand of the followers of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and ſome of the Diſcipline of Antichriſt, as <hi>Paraeus;</hi> but ſtill <hi>Brightman</hi> takes in both: and this I do aſſure you, never doth the ſmoak ariſe out of the bottomleſs pit, but it breeds Locuſts, there doth ariſe out of it abundance of wicked and worthleſs men, that go by troops and would ſurely devour all; and it's Satans plot againſt the Church of God, and therefore the moſt dangerous, and that in which he doth put the moſt confidence, he doth love to raiſe perſecution, and to roar like a Lion when he can, but if that do not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his end, then he betakes himſelf unto this, he caſts a flood out of his mouth; but ſtill his end is the ſame, that the woman that was not devoured by the great red Dragon

                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> For Anſwer to it, I would firſt lay down theſe poſitions: (1.) It's plain in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that there is but one God, and that an Idol is nothing in the world, there is none other God but one, as it is, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 8.4. <hi>The Lord thy God, is one Lord.</hi> (2.) The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaks of <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and they are ſaid expreſly to be Three, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are diſtinguiſhed from one another, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. <hi>For there are Three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe Three are one.</hi> (3.) The God-head in Scripture is attributed to them all, and the eſſential properties of an infinite being: He is called God the Father,<note place="margin">John 1.1.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6. and the Word is God, the ſame Word that was incarnate, and was made fleſh, and this Word is God, and the Spirit dwells in the hearts of the Faithful all the world over, and that both in Heaven and Earth, and therefore muſt be every where preſent changing the hearts of men, which nothing but an Almighty and a Creating Power can do, and doth know their hearts, for he doth ſupply them with graces and influences daily, and helps their infirmities, and teaches them to pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which can be done by none but he that is God; and they are therefore ſaid to be one, becauſe the God-head of the Divine Eſſence is but one.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.7.</note> (4.) There is ſomething attributed unto one in the Scripture, that cannot be ſaid of another: the Father is not the Son, and the Son is not the Father; the Father doth beget, and is not begotten, the Son is begotten of the Father, and cannot be ſaid to beget; the Son is ſaid to take fleſh, <hi>the Word was made fleſh,</hi> and ſo did not the Father; the Son was ſaid to be ſent, and ſo is not the Father, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are diſtinguiſhed, yet it's plain that they are but one God: this is plainly the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that is delivered unto the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Now let us apply this unto the Argument in hand, and we will, (1.) Retort it, they are Three, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; theſe are either ſomething or nothing, they are ſubſtances or accidents, they are finite or infinite; and the ſame inconveniences will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn upon themſelves, for they muſt aſſert them to be Three, and yet one, for a Trinity in Unity the Scripture doth clearly hold forth. (2.) It's not ſtrange, even amongſt the Creatures, that the ſame perſon ſhould be a Man and a Father, yet as a Father diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from himſelf as a Man, and a Son diſtinguiſhed from himſelf as a Man, therefore it's not ſtrange in this, that the Father ſhould be diſtinguiſhed from himſelf as God, and the Son alſo: The Scripture does clearly ſpeak to us of certain <hi>actiones ad intra,</hi> which are in God, which do not refer to the Creatures, but to Father, Son and Spirit, amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; as the Father does beget, and the Son is begotten, and the Holy Ghoſt proceeds from both; and from theſe actions do ariſe the relative properties, of Father, Son and Spirit, in one and the ſame eſſence; and therefore if any man ſay, a perſon is ſomething or nothing, I ſay it is ſomething, it is, <hi>Eſſentia Divina cum proprietate ſua hypoſtatica, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence with its relative propertie:</hi> As what is the Father? He is God begetting the Son; and what is the Son? He is God, and begotten of the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is infinite, and the Son infinite, becauſe they have all Three an Unity of Eſſence, which is infinite, and therefore there is no reaſon why there ſhould be ſo much exception againſt the title of <hi>Perſon,</hi> as ſome of the looſer ſort would ſeem to take it, being a word that doth moſt fully, that I know, expreſs the nature of the thing, that we can have, and moſt anſwers the word <gap reason="foreign">

As in the work of Faith the Soul is to be exerciſed upon all the Perſons, ſo alſo in the point of Aſſurance, which is an addition unto Faith, we ſhould wait for the Witneſs, and the ſealing of them all, becauſe all of them ſet their ſeals unto the Evidences of the Saints: The ſcope of the Epiſtle of <hi>John</hi> is,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.7.</note> that the Saints may know that they have Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life and there are Witneſſes ſome in Heaven, and ſome in Earth, but yet the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies that theſe give all of them are in the heart of a Believer: for ſo it is ſaid, <hi>He that believes hath the witneſs within himſelf,</hi> the Father, the Word, and the Spirit,<note place="margin">Verſ. 10.</note> and theſe three perſons in Heaven give a diſtinct witneſs unto the aſſurance of the Saints in their own hearts; there are three ſeals that are ſet unto it: though it's true, that a man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Love of any one of them, he may by conſequence, and by way of deduction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Love of them all; yet a man ſhould expect to have it not only diſcurſive, but intuitive, <hi>&amp; radio directo, by a direct beam,</hi> that a man may in Prayer from a principle of ſealing, cry to God, <hi>Abba Father,</hi> and may ſay, <hi>I am my beloveds, and my beloved is mine:</hi> and ſo the Soul may walk in the Love of them all diſtinctly though not ſeverally; and the Soul is never able to triumph and make his boaſt of God, till he has aſſurance of his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in all the perſons; and in all theſe reſpects we ſee that the great grounds of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians comfort lye in his intereſt in the perſons, and therefore it's no wonder if the great promiſes of the Covenant to a Chriſtian be perſonal promiſes.</p>

                  <p n="1">§. 1. LEt us come more particularly unto the words of the Promiſe, in which the main of the Covenant lyes on Gods part, for we have heard it's unfolded in promiſes, or to uſe the Apoſtles word, <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> in Promiſes,<note place="margin">Hebr. 8.6.</note> and theſe promiſes <hi>Muſculus</hi> calls <hi>Caput foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deris, the Head of the Covenant:</hi> the chief and the bottom promiſe, on which the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſtands, is this, <hi>I will be thy God:</hi> and <hi>Pareus</hi> calls it <hi>anima foederis, the ſoul of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;</hi> for it's the principal promiſe of the Second Covenant: as in our part of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, there is one great Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart;</hi> ſo there is in Gods part of the Covenant one great promiſe, and that is, that <hi>he will be our God, and we ſhall be his people,</hi> and therefore a great weight is to be laid upon it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the opening of it we are to conſider there are Two things to be diſtinctly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in God: (1.) <hi>Eſſentia, his Eſſence:</hi> (2.) <hi>Subſiſtentia, his Subſiſtence.</hi> (1.) The Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God is but one pure and ſimple act of Being, but yet cannot be comprehended as ſuch by a finite underſtanding, becauſe it's infinite; therefore it is ſet forth unto us by ſeveral Attributes, which though in God they be all one, yet they are diverſify'd accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the different objects upon which they are ſet, and about which they are converſant, and the different acts that they do put forth unto the Creatures: and ſo when the Lord doth promiſe to be our God, he doth make over unto the Creature by promiſe an intereſt in all the Attributes of the Eſſence and Divine Nature. (2.) In this Divine Nature there are three diſtinct ſubſiſtences, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is the word uſed by the Apoſtle;<note place="margin">Hebr. 1.3.</note> and why we ſhould be offended, as ſome of late, at the word Perſon, by which it is expreſſed, I know not, but from the novelty and curioſity of this laſt Age: There is in the God-head, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Spirit, and theſe Three are One.<note place="margin">Joh. 5.7.</note> Now when the Lord doth promiſe to be a God to his People, he doth make over his whole ſelf, God in Eſſence, according to all the Attributes of his Nature, and God in Subſiſtence, according unto all the perſons or ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtences in the God-head; and it is very neceſſary, that as in point of obedience we take in the whole latitude and extent of the Law, for the Commandment is exceeding broad, ſo in point of Faith alſo, that we take in the whole latitude and extent of the promiſes; that as in the one our hearts and deſires in obeying may anſwer God's in commanding, ſo in the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:52030:152"/> other our hearts and deſires in believing may anſwer God's in promiſing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To be a God implies a ſufficiency. (1) It is a term of <hi>Sufficiency,</hi> and ſo it is here, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>I am God all-ſufficient: he that is ſelf-ſufficient in himſelf, is all-ſufficient to his people.</hi> What is there that can be neceſſary unto your happineſs, but it ſhall be had in me? and therefore <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. <hi>ult. Bleſſed is the people whoſe God is Jehovah;</hi> becauſe in God there is an all-ſufficiency, that not only you ſhall have all happineſs from him, but you ſhall have all things in him: ſo that as he is ſufficient for himſelf, of and from himſelf, without going forth unto any other; ſo ſhall you have all things in him immediately, that you need look unto nothing elſe to make you happy; for all the perfections of a God ſhall be yours. (2) To be a God is a term of <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> for he is the moſt high King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,<note place="margin">Dan. 4.17.</note> the moſt High rules in the Kingdoms of mortal men, and he is God over all,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.5.</note> bleſſed for evermore. Therefore to be a mans God is to undertake the rule and government over him, and to rule and govern all things for his good, that they may be all unto him a bleſſing;<note place="margin">Eph. 1. v. <hi>ult.</hi>
                     </note> that as Chriſt is made the head of all things for the Churches ſake, ſo will the Lord rule over all things for his peoples ſake, rule all as a God, as truly for their good, as for his own glory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It points alſo to the <hi>manner</hi> of the fulfilling of this promiſe, it ſhall be as becomes a God, and in the way of a God: and ſo much alſo <hi>A Lapide</hi> hints upon the place, <hi>Ero tuus tuorúm<expan>

                        </expan> Deus, ut à vobis ſolus colar, I will be the God of thee and thine, that I may be worſhipped by thee.</hi> Now there are two ways by which a people employ their intereſt in God, (1) by way of <hi>Communion,</hi> they come unto God, and they draw near to him, which are terms of Communion, (2) by way of <hi>Fruition,</hi> their happineſs is in him, and he will be their portion and reward in the land of the living. When the Lord caſts off a people from being a Church to himſelf, he will own them in ways of worſhip no more, he doth expreſs it ſo,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 1.9.</note> calls them <hi>Loammi, they are not my people,</hi> I will not be their God: he does not ſay, You ſhall not have the creatures to be yours, as the fruits of my bounty, you ſhall not have reſpite of torment, as the fruits of my patience; but yet when you have all things here below, you ſhall not have me in them all, in ways of communion here, or of fruition hereafter.</p>

                     <hi>The main intendment of God in the new Covenant is this, That he may become the God of his people.</hi> Every man that is brought into the new Covenant doth change his God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.10. it's ſaid, <hi>Paſs over to the Iſles of Chittim, and ſend unto Kedar, and ſee if there be ſuch a thing, has any nation changed their God?</hi> It's looked upon as a ſtrange thing in the world, and yet this is the condition of all thoſe that come under the ſecond Covenant; and therefore as the great Commandment to a people is, <hi>Thou ſhalt have Jehovah for thy God, and thou ſhalt have none elſe;</hi> ſo the great promiſe on Gods part is, that <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> that though the earth be mine, and the fulneſs thereof, all ſouls are mine, yet <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> and thy portion, as if there were no other men in the world beſides thee. There is a double change wrought in the Saints, (1) a change of a mans ſtate, (2) a change of a mans life. The firſt is the great and the univerſal change that God works in men at their firſt converſion, and that the School-men do well ſay is <hi>mutatio circa finem ultimum, a change of a mans utmoſt end.</hi> Now <hi>finis ultimus &amp; ſummum bonum inter ſe convertuntur, the laſt end and chiefeſt good are convertible:</hi> therefore he that doth change his utmoſt end, does alſo change his chiefeſt good, and he that doth ſo, doth change his God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Here we are to conſider, that all mankind that are out of covenant with God, have no intereſt in God, they have all of them another God. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. they are all of them Atheiſts, or men without God. Before <hi>Abraham</hi> was taken into covenant with God, he did ſerve <hi>other Gods beyond the river with Terah his father, Joſh.</hi> 24.2. but when he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into covenant, the main intendment of the Covenant was this, he ſhall change his God. Now <hi>I will make a covenant with thee, to be a God to thee and thy ſeed,</hi> and thou ſhalt worſhip the Nations god no more. It's true that there are no men but they have ſome impreſſions of a Deity upon them; every man worſhips ſome God, a <hi>Numen</hi> he doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and there is a God that every one doth chuſe unto himſelf, as it is ſaid in <hi>Judges,</hi> they choſe new Gods, but they are called <hi>Stercorarii,</hi> they are dunghil-gods, they are not the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> they are not the God that makes over himſelf in covenant unto his people, but they are new Gods newly come up. It's true, he that is without the true God, will be ready to fancy any thing to himſelf as a God; therefore one man doth adore himſelf, and another this or that creature, and another ſerves his belly as his God, and the other he chuſes Mammon for his God, every man as his fancy leads him; for all theſe Gods are nothing elſe but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,<note place="margin">Act. 7.43.</note> but the truth is, it is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil that is worſhipped under all theſe forms as a God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.17. <hi>They ſacrificed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and not unto God:</hi> or Demons or new-made Gods newly come up, whom their Fathers
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:52030:152"/> knew not: and ſo did the Gentiles in all their ways of worſhip, they ſacrificed unto De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.20.</note> and not unto God. And ſo it is in the worſhipping of Saints and Angels under Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, it's but worſhipping of <hi>Devils</hi> or <hi>Demons,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 9.20.</note> they repented not of the works of their hands, that they ſhould not worſhip Devils, &amp;c. And for this cauſe the Doctrine of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping Saints is called the <hi>Doctrine of Devils,</hi> or <hi>Demons.</hi> And it's true in both ſenſes, either the worſhipping of Saints, or the worſhipping of Devils in them. And this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Idolatry of all unregenerate men in the world,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.4.</note> they do worſhip Satan who is the God of this world; and therefore all unregenerate men being of this world, they have no God but the God of the world, and therefore it's ſaid of the world, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19.<note place="margin">In aliquo poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſſe, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus poteſtate eſſe. <hi>Camer.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>The world lies in wickedneſs:</hi> it notes the higheſt ſubjection to the Devil that can be, to be ſubject to him as God. And this is the great ſin of all unregenerate men, who are out of covenant with the Lord; and therefore it's well called by <hi>Tertullian, Principale crimen humani generis &amp; ſummus ſeculi reatus, The principal crime of mankind and chief guilt of the age.</hi> So that every man that has not the Lord for his God in covenant, he worſhips the Devil for his God inſtead of the true God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When men are in covenant with God, they do change their God, and Jehovah be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes their God. And that will appear in two things. (1) The Lord ſtyles himſelf their God; and therefore when he had taken <hi>Abraham</hi> into covenant with himſelf,<note place="margin">Exod. 3.6.</note> then he calls himſelf the God of <hi>Abraham:</hi> and it's ſaid <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16. of all the Saints, <hi>He is not aſhamed to be called their God.</hi> And that's the great promiſe of the Covenant,<note place="margin">Jer. 31.33. 2 Cor. 6.16. Rev. 21.7.</note> 
                     <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people. He that overcomes ſhall inherit all things, I will be his God.</hi> (2) Upon this ground they do claim an intereſt in him as their God: ſo doth <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 15.2. <hi>Thou art my God, and thou art my father's God.</hi> So doth <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 63.1. <hi>Thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee:</hi> and ſo doth <hi>Eſa.</hi> 7.13. <hi>Will you weary my God alſo?</hi> ſo doth the Church, <hi>God, even our own God ſhall bleſs us: this God is our God for ever and ever.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 67.6. Pſal. 48. v. <hi>ult.</hi>
                     </note> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all they that are in covenant with God, they have the Lord for their God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now what is there that doth make the Lord to become our God, that a man may ſay he has changed his God?</hi> There are three things in the new Covenant that give a man a propriety in God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Lord doth graciouſly and freely make over himſelf: it's an ordinary thing amongſt men to make over a propriety, either in things or perſons, by covenant; as you have heard, the wife by covenant has a propriety in the husband, and the husband in the wife; and ſo the Prince has a propriety in the Subject, and the Subject in the Prince. Now the Lord doth thus freely make over himſelf unto his people by covenant with them to be a God to them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a Union with Jeſus Chriſt that the Saints have, they are one body with him, and the Covenant of grace being made primarily with Chriſt, the Lord becomes his God in covenant, and ſo he ſaith, <hi>I aſcend unto my Father and your Father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 20.17. Pſal. 22.1.</note> 
                     <hi>unto my God and your God: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Therefore the great intention of this Covenant was, that the Lord might become the God of Chriſt, as he is the Mediator, and being his God, and we being one with him, he becomes our God alſo.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a free and a voluntary acceptation and conſent on the creatures part to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this God for his, and to give up himſelf to him, to perform all thoſe acts of ſoul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him as becomes a God: the Lord will not receive a man for his that has another God, he muſt caſt off all the dunghil-gods that before he ſerved. He ſaith, <hi>What have I to do any more with Idols?</hi> He doth <hi>caſt his Idols of ſilver and gold unto the moles and to the bats.</hi> It's not honourable for the great God to put himſelf upon a people to be their God againſt their will, and therefore there goes forth an illumination upon the hearts of his people, by which they chuſe him for their God, and they will own no other: and this mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conſent between God and them doth compleat their intereſt and propriety in him. How did <hi>Dagon</hi> become the God of the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> and <hi>Apis</hi> the God of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and <hi>Chemoſh</hi> the God of the <hi>Ammonites?</hi> it was, becauſe they choſe them unto themſelves to worſhip them; and there is no means to ſet up a God over a people, and to intitle them to him but by their own conſent: and ſo it is with the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it is becauſe they yield themſelves <hi>to give the hand to the Lord:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Chron. 30.8.</note> 
                     <hi>They gave themſelves firſt to God</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle <hi>Paul) and then to us, by the will of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. And by this means it is, that he that is taken into covenant with God, doth change his God, and take the Lord for his God. The Lord doth make over himſelf unto him in the Covenant to be his God, and he does conſent to it, and ſays, This God ſhall be my God for ever and ever, and I will have no other God but him.</p>

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:52030:153"/> world; and that will appear 1. in this, it's the greateſt ſin to live without God, it's againſt the great Commandment of the Law, and againſt the grand promiſe of the Goſpel: the great Commandment of the Law is, <hi>Thou ſhalt have Jehovah for thy God, and thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God.</hi> If he that loves his wife loves himſelf, much more he that loves his God muſt love himſelf moſt; for he is, as the School-men ſpeak, <hi>intimior intimo noſtro, more intimate than our moſt intimate part:</hi> he is nearer unto a man than a man is to himſelf; and therefore converſion being a writing the Law in the heart, this being the great Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this is ſpecially written there, <hi>to love the Lord our God with all our heart:</hi> and the truth is, upon this all the other Commandments do depend, on this hang all the Law and the Prophets; and therefore <hi>Auſtin</hi> well obſerves, <hi>Qui non diligit Deum non diligit proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum, quia non diligit ſeipſum, He that loves not God loves not his neighbour, becauſe he loves not himſelf.</hi> A man ought to love his neighbour as himſelf; but he that loves not himſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love his neighbour: and he that doth not love God, neither doth he, nor can he love himſelf, he hates his own ſoul: and as this command <hi>to love God</hi> is the greateſt, it is the grand promiſe of the Goſpel, <hi>that the Lord will be our God.</hi> Now in a mans converſion as the precepts are written in the heart as ſoon as he is new-born to God, as the rule of his obedience;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.2, 3.</note> ſo alſo are all the promiſes written in his heart, as the ground of his faith: <hi>Ye are</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>the Epiſtle of Chriſt miniſtred by us, written, not with ink, but by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the living God, in the fleſhly tables of your heart.</hi> And therefore as it is in vain for a man to ſpeak of obedience unto leſſer precepts, if the great Commandments be wanting; ſo it's in vain to claim an intereſt in inferior promiſes, if the great promiſe, <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> thou haſt no part in.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The baſeneſs and unworthineſs of a mans ſpirit is ſeen in nothing ſo much as in this, that a man can take any thing for a God.

Therefore to be miſtaken in a mans God, and to joyn himſelf unto a ſtrange God,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 9.10.</note> is the greateſt reproach that can befal a man. It's ſaid of <hi>Iſrael, That they joyned themſelves unto Baal-Peor, and ſeparated themſelves unto that ſhame,</hi> and they were abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable <hi>ſecundum amorem eorum, according to their love,</hi> that is, as the Gods that they loved, as God is called the fear of his people.</p>

                     <hi>exceeding great,</hi> and it's as much as to ſay, <hi>thy greateſt reward.</hi> There are variety of rewards that God gives unto all his labourers, even in this life; though it be true, as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſe Ben Iſrael</hi> has obſerved, <hi>That this life is mundus laboris, the world of labour,</hi> and the world to come <hi>retributionis, of reward;</hi> yet the reward is begun in this life. There is no man that ſhall labour for God in vain, no man ſhall ſhut his door, or open it for nothing; but yet God doth give many things as a reward unto thoſe to whom he doth never give himſelf, becauſe there are many that do work for God, that do never give themſelves unto God: and therefore <hi>Jehu</hi> ſhall have a Kingdom, and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſhall have <hi>Egypt</hi> for his hire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they have their reward from God, but yet the Lord himſelf is not their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.

There is a diſcovery of God that is beyond the capacity of grace in this life, and the people of God by virtue of this promiſe may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the hope of it, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. but yet they cannot poſſeſs it in this life; but as the Lord has revealed himſelf to his people in this life, ſo he hath made over himſelf unto them.

                  <p n="2">2. This will appear alſo if we conſider the Promiſes are, that we ſhall have all in God; <hi>He that overcomes ſhall inherit all things, I will be his God;</hi> the Lord is his Inheritance,<note place="margin">Revel. 21.7.</note> and he that has God he doth inherit all things, he ſhall have a hundred-fold more in this life,<note place="margin">Mark 10.30.</note> that forſakes any comfort of it for God, in this preſent time: Now a man cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this <hi>formaliter, formally,</hi> but <hi>eminentèr, eminently,</hi> he ſhall have that in God that ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all this, if they were a hundred times multiplyed; and ſo the Lord is a Sun, and a Shield,<note place="margin">Pſal. 84.</note> and how is all this to be underſtood, but that we have all in God?

                  <p n="3">3. So much the ſeveral relations in which God ſtands to his People do imply; the Lord is ſaid to be unto them a Father, <hi>I will be their Father, and they ſhall be my Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. It will appear alſo by the expreſſions in Scripture, that the Saints have intereſt in ſeveral Attributes of God, and from their intereſt in ſome of them, we may conclude their intereſt in all, for God is not divided; <hi>Integram ſalutem à Deo diviſo ſperare non poſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, we may not hope for an entire ſalvation from a divided God,</hi> Pſal. 59.10. he is call'd not only the God of Mercy, as he is commonly, but the God of <hi>my Mercy;</hi> ſo of all the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that was in God, <hi>David</hi> lays claim to it as <hi>his Mercy;</hi> it's in God indeed <hi>ſubjectivè,</hi> but yet it is mine, even all the Mercy that is in God, and he is the God of my Mercy:<note place="margin">Pſal. 84.5.

                  <p n="2">§. 2. <hi>This is peculiar to the Second Covenant, that the Lord ſhould make over unto his people the inheritance of all his Attributes.</hi> 1. It's true, that <hi>Adam</hi> had an intereſt in God, or elſe he could not have loſt it: But we have heard of Mans great miſery in the Fall, that it lay in his loſs of God,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.12.</note> and we know that if he had continued in that ſtate of Innocency, that Covenant would have brought him unto God; for death threatned upon his breach of it was eternal ſeparation from God in Hell, therefore the Life promiſed muſt be an eternal fruition of God in Heaven; but yet it was not ſuch an intereſt as the Saints have under the ſecond Covenant, for that was limited only unto one condition, that men if they did ſtand in their integrity, the Lord would be ſo unto them, but if they fell, the Lord would become their God no more, but now is become their enemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But there is this in the New Covenant, that the Lord is their God in all conditions whatever, and they have in all conditions an intereſt in all the Attributes; and they may expect that they ſhall be all imployed for them, and every Saint may conclude with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goodneſs and mercy ſhall follow me all my dayes;</hi> which is more than the <hi>petra ſequens, that Rock that followed</hi> the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſs, in their long journey; they had wiſdom to direct them, and power to protect them, and mercy to pardon them, and grace to heal them; and ſo it is of all the other Attributes of God, they belong unto his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in all conditions, and though there be never ſo great changes in them, yet there is no change in the Lord.<note place="margin">Iſai. 57.17, 18.</note> We read in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57.17, 18. of a man in a wicked way, and the Lord corrects him, but he goes on freely in the way of his heart; now what ſhould the Lord do? <hi>Felix cui Deus dignatur iraſci,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Happy man with whom the Lord is angry:</hi> but if this avail not, caſts he him off, as he did the Devils, and the Angels that ſinned? nay, the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes are now ingaged, and though the man be unfaithful to God, yet the Lord has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himſelf to be his God, and therefore he ſays, <hi>I have ſeen his ways, and I will heal him, I am his God, and he is mine</hi> for all this, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Under the Second Covenant there is a fuller and a more glorious diſcovery of all the Attributes than there was under the Firſt Covenant. As the Saints have a greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Attributes of God than the Angels have, ſo they are more fully revealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Saints, than they were to the Angels; and therefore they are ſaid to go to School to the Church to learn;<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3.10.</note> for by the Church they are taught <hi>the manifold wiſdom of God:</hi> The Lord Chriſt as Mediator is a Glorious Stage, upon which all the Attributes do ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly act their parts;<note place="margin">Exod. 23.</note> and therefore the Lord ſaith of Chriſt, <hi>My Name is in him,</hi> and he is therefore called,<note place="margin">Coloſ. 1.15.</note> 
                     <hi>the Image of the inviſible God,</hi> becauſe all the Glory of God doth ſhine forth in him. (1.) Here are ſome Attributes that could never have been diſcovered under
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:52030:156"/> the firſt Covenant, and thoſe are [1] the mercy of God, as it reſpects miſery; for had the firſt Covenant continued, there had been no miſery, and therefore no place for mercy: [2] the love of God to mankind, when he did catch at man fallen, and did let the Angels go, as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.6. [3] the patience and the long-ſuffering of God; for there had been no place for theſe, if the Lord had not been provoked by ſin againſt the ſinner; for it is it that hardens them in their impenitency, and magnifies this patience of God that he can bear ſo long with ſuch ſinners. (2) All the Attributes under the ſecond Covenant are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in a far higher way than they could have been under the firſt Covenant. [1] There was higher wiſdom diſcovered than in the Creation; indeed there was great wiſdom in making a World and in giving a Law, but there is a <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>manifold wiſdom</hi> in this, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.10. that the Angels that had ſtudied the wiſdom of God in the firſt Edition, ever ſince their Creation, now do deſire to look into this Myſtery,<note place="margin">

                        </gap>.</note> or they ſtooped and with great diligence and obſervation looked into it: but now there is ſuch a diſcovery of wiſdome as was never known to the world before; which is a ſecond Edition, and has put the Angels to School again; and therefore <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſays, There is a threefold know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Angels, 1. <hi>matutina, morning,</hi> that which they had of God in their Creation, 2. <hi>reſpectiva, reſpective,</hi> that which they did attain further of God <hi>rebus ipſis, from their own experience</hi> and obſervation, 3. the knowledge that they have of God in Chriſt, and that he calls <hi>meridiana, meridian knowledge.</hi> [2] There is a greater power under the ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant than was under the firſt Covenant; for that was but to command a creature to ſtand up out of nothing, and it was done by a word; but now for the Godhead to joyn it ſelf into a perſonal union with the creature is much more: the power of God over a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not ſo much as the power of God over himſelf, for to forgive ſin is an act of power;<note place="margin">Num. 14.17.</note> to ſupport a creature againſt himſelf, and his own revenging hand under the guilt of ſin, ſhews the depth of wiſdom and grace. [3] There is greater Juſtice under the ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; for the firſt Covenant being broken, Gods rejection of <hi>Adam</hi> was but rejecting of a creature; and the Angels they were but Gods Servants, and he might puniſh them for their ſin; but herein is higher Juſtice, when God will not ſpare his Son; and his ſtrong crys and tears moved him not, nay and God himſelf was to be his Executioner, and yet his Juſtice is pleaſed with it, It pleaſed the Father to bruiſe him, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53. <hi>conterere,</hi> it ſignifies to <hi>grinde one to powder,</hi> for that is to make one contrite, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he hath put him to grief, and he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, and was bruiſed for our ſins. [4] There was a greater diſcovery of Gods truth under the ſecond Covenant. Under the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant the Lord had ſpoken the word, <hi>the day thou eateſt thou ſhalt dye;</hi> and the Lord was as good as his word, and had caſt off man, and Angels by it, but they were as clay in his hand, he had no need of them: but now if his Son will undertake it, ſurely one would think God would either abrogate his Law, or mitigate it; but the Lord will do neither, his truth ſhall ſtand rather than Heaven or Earth, and therefore if the Son of God be made ſin, he ſhall be made a curſe alſo.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Under the ſecond Covenant we have a firmer hold upon all the Attributes, than we could ever have had under the firſt Covenant: the Lord was the God of <hi>Adam,</hi> and alſo of the Angels; but yet ſo as he might by their Covenant become their enemy, if they were not confirmed by his grace, in the new Covenant: therefore the Angels are beholding to Chriſt for their confirmation, as well as men are for their reconciliation; but the Lord becomes the God of his people ſo under the ſecond Covenant, that he is their God for ever and ever, <hi>this God is our God for ever and ever.</hi>

Joh. 17.23.</note> but the ſame claim alſo unto God that Chriſt has; for we can ſay, <hi>that whatever is in God is ours,</hi> becauſe he is become our God; and therefore he is ſaid <hi>to love us as he loved Chriſt:</hi> and a great ground of a Chriſtians conſolation comes in by it, that they may know that thou haſt loved them, even as thou haſt loved me, and that the love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thou haſt loved me may be in them, that is, that this love in the apprehenſion and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it, may be ſhed abroad in their hearts abundantly; and that under this notion, that it's the ſame love that God bears unto us, that he did bear unto the Lord Chriſt, as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; it is to be underſtood of an <hi>as</hi> of <hi>ſimilitude,</hi> not of <hi>equality;</hi> it was ſuch a love as made over not only all creatures unto Chriſt, but all Attributes unto Chriſt, and it was a love that gave Chriſt an union and an unction; and ſuch a love it is unto us in both: but conſider it is but <hi>pro modulo,</hi> according unto our condition, ſo as the Lord Chriſt in all things may have the preheminence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Lord hath made over all his Attributes to Chriſt as Mediator, that they ſhall all of them work and be employed for us, according unto the neceſſity we are in. For Chriſt did not only as Mediator make way for all the Attributes to work, and to be put forth for us, that ſo no Attribute might ſtand in the way of mercy and goodneſs towards us; and ſo Chriſt came in as <hi>cauſa removens prohibens,</hi> &amp;c. but all the Attributes thus made over to Chriſt in covenant, are all of them to be acted and exerciſed by Chriſt as Mediator; as the government of all the creatures is committed to him, ſo alſo the diſcovery and the exerciſe of all the Attributes of God are committed to him; and therefore it's ſaid, <hi>My Angel ſhall go before thee;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 23.21.</note> and that Angel that God ſent and led his people in the Wilderneſs was Chriſt, called therefore <hi>the Angel of his preſence,</hi> or <hi>of his face,</hi> becauſe in him the face or the glory of God is diſcovered,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.10.</note> and not only becauſe he doth behold his face, for ſo do the other Angels: it cannot be ſpoken of Chriſt as God, for ſo he is not the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, that is, the Meſſenger of God ſent forth from God; and it's ſaid of this Angel, <hi>that the name of God is in him.</hi> Now the name of God is whatever God is made known by; and therefore when the Lord doth publiſh his Attributes he ſaith, <hi>he will proclaim his name,

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though all the Attributes be made over unto us in this manner, yet it's after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain order in the Attributes: the Attribute that the ſoul doth firſt cloſe with is the <hi>mercy</hi> and the <hi>free grace</hi> and <hi>love</hi> of God; and by that a man comes to have an intereſt in all the reſt; and the Attribute that is ingaged for all is the <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> of God. (1) The attribute that the ſoul firſt cloſes with is his love and mercy and free grace, which are the attributes that the Lord doth mainly exalt in this life, and has moſt gloriouſly ſet forth, and therefore 'tis called <hi>riches of mercy,</hi> and the <hi>glory of God, the knowledge of the glory of God.</hi> It's this attribute in which the Lord doth mainly glory,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.6.</note> and therefore it's called his <hi>glory;</hi> and it's ſaid, <hi>that mercy rejoyceth over judgment;</hi> for in the time of this life under the offers of the Covenant of grace the attribute that God doth mainly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe in the Goſpel is free grace, <hi>that God is in Chriſt reconciling the world,</hi> and <hi>has ſent abroad the miniſtry of reconciliation;</hi> and <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.</hi> This is the great Load-ſtone that doth draw in the heart unto God,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.14.</note> 
                     <hi>God who is rich in mercy, out of his abundant love,</hi> &amp;c. Now the ſoul being thus drawn in with a cord of love, the Lord giving a command unto loving kindneſs to fetch in ſuch a wandring ſoul unto himſelf, hence the ſoul at firſt coming unto God grounded upon his mercy, by cloſing with him in this, is made partaker of all the attributes of God, and has an intereſt in them all; but ſo as the ſoul doth cloſe with mercy firſt, and with free grace. As it is in the offices of Chriſt, the ſoul doth cloſe with them all, and has an intereſt in them all; but yet ſo, as it doth take Chriſt as he is offered him by the Father, and that is, firſt as a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> as a <hi>ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> for ſinners, and as one <hi>ſet forth to be a propitiation for ſin;</hi> and the ſoul having in this manner cloſed with Chriſt as a Prieſt, and having a title to the Prieſtly Office, now he has taken whole Chriſt, and ſubmits to him as his <hi>Prophet</hi> and <hi>King</hi> alſo: thus as the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate object of faith that juſtifies is Chriſt dying and riſing, and as made ſin, and as made a curſe for us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then the ſoul having cloſed with Chriſt, it has an intereſt in whole Chriſt with all his Offices: ſo it's here alſo; though all the attributes of God are glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diſplayed in the ſecond Covenant, yet the attribute that mainly the Lord delights to honour is mercy and free grace; and the ſoul firſt cloſes with this, and ſo comes to have a title and an intereſt in all that is in God, in every attribute. (2) As his love is the firſt attribute that the ſoul cloſes with, and ſo comes to have an intereſt in them all; ſo it's his <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> that is ingaged for the exerciſe of them all, and therefore all our forgiveneſs is put upon his faithfulneſs: <hi>He is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 49.7.</note> How do we know that the pardoning mercy of God ſhall be exerciſed towards us, when we have ſinned? <hi>God is faithful who has promiſed:</hi>

                  <p n="4">§. 4. <hi>What are the ends for which God has in Covenant made over the Attributes unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?</hi> They are many, and we ſhall beſt diſcover them by the uſe that the people of God have of all the attributes in the Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That they may be all diſcovered and made known unto the Saints: there is in all men a blindneſs of heart, and that ſpecially in reference unto God, from whom they are eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:52030:158"/> through the ignorance that is in them.<note place="margin">Eph. 4.18, 19.</note> Now they having an intereſt in them all, the Lord will proclaim his name, and cauſe his mercy and goodneſs to paſs before them, though not in that viſible manner as he did unto <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 33.19.</note> yet in a more ſpiritual way they do behold the glory of God in the face of Chriſt Jeſus;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.6.</note> and therefore the great aim of God in all his works is the diſcovery of his attributes unto the Saints, and all his great works are done to that very end, and therefore he gives them a Law that he may manifeſt his Holineſs: To ſhew his power he has made a world, to manifeſt his love he has given Chriſt, to declare his grace he doth pardon ſin, and to ſhew his juſtice and wrath he has made Hell, and laid the foundations of the bottomleſs pit: and this is the firſt end why God has made over his attributes unto his people, it is that they may know them; and therefore the great thing the Saints look at in all Gods works, and his goings forth is, what attributes are diſcovered: <hi>I would ſee thy power and thy glory in the Sanctuary:</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2.

And the Lord encourages the ſoul from the aſſurance of his power, <hi>Is my arm ſhortned, that I cannot ſave, is any thing too hard for the Lord,</hi> is there any reſtraint to omnipotence? And ſo alſo Chriſt puts them upon it in this, With man it's impoſſible, but with God all things are poſſible; it's ſpoken in reference to a work of Sanctification, when the Diſciples ſaid, <hi>Who then can be ſaved?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eſay 26.4.

We know that the <hi>ultimate object</hi> of faith is God through Jeſus Chriſt;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.21.</note> our faith and hope is in God: now the higheſt object of faith in God is the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God, that he has diſcovered: for we can believe in him no otherwiſe than we know him, and as he has revealed himſelf; and the way of Gods revealing himſelf unto his people in this life, is only by his back parts, which are his attributes, and therefore this is the way of the acting of faith in this life, and all the promiſes of God, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and the threatnings of God are all of them founded on his attributes, and in theſe doth the ſtrength and ſtability of them lye, becauſe the Lord Jehovah is a rock of ages: As it is in ends, all intermediate ends work in the ſtrength and the power of the utmoſt end; ſo it is in objects alſo, <hi>Objectum mediatum fidei movet in virtute objecti ultimati, &amp; ab eo perfectionem accipit, The mediate object of faith moves in the virtue of the ultimate object, and receives perfection from it.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Eph. 4.18.23.24.</note>3. That from theſe the ſoul may receive all principles of grace: grace is called <hi>the Life of God;</hi> and <hi>the Divine Nature, the Image of God</hi> created in the ſoul it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>according unto God.</hi> Now in an image there are two things required, (1) <hi>Proportion</hi> or <hi>ſimilitude</hi> and reſemblance. (2) There is a <hi>deduction</hi> or a <hi>derivation,</hi> it muſt be taken from it. As there is a reſemblance of the nature of God, ſo there is a <hi>derivation</hi> of it from God. Now though the incommunicable attributes of God are ſo called, becauſe there are in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures no footſteps or reſemblances, yet there are of the attributes that are communicable; from them the image of God is derived unto us, and we are made partakers of his holineſs, <hi>holy as he is holy,</hi>

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:52030:158"/> and ſo far grace is the image of God in us but in part, a good work begun, and no more; and it is a diſcovery of his attributes, which are the original pattern that doth perfect his image in us, which is but the counterpane; and therefore we ſhall be perfectly like him, when we ſhall ſee him as he is, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God hath in Covenant made over his Attributes, that from theſe the ſoul may take all rules of duty: and as the higheſt objects of faith are in God, ſo from him are the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt rules of duty: and therefore <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.1. the exhortation is, <hi>Be ye imitators of God,</hi>

And it's the argument that he himſelf uſeth as the rule unto them in their performances, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.13. <hi>I am a great King, and my name is dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful amongst the Heathen:</hi> As the ſoul is never rightly bottomed upon a promiſe, till it is carried out into that attribute upon which the promiſe doth depend; ſo the ſoul is never grounded in duty, till it looks beyond the precept, and ſees the attributes in God, which are the foundation of the duty; and this is properly to walk worthy of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10. <hi>That ye may walk worthy,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p n="5">5. That the great motives unto duty, and the great reſtraints from ſin be taken from theſe. It's a matter of great conſequence, not only that we do the duties that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, but alſo what motives they are that fill the ſails in our performances. For a man to perform high duties upon low motives, argues a heart full of fleſh: to preach the Goſpel is a high ſervice, but to do it to ſerve a mans belly or his pride, to gather Diſciples after him, that he may have the credit of a Teacher of others, and be cryed up amongſt them; this doth in a great meaſure blaſt all his ſervice; therefore let men look to their motives in their performances. And ſo for ſin, it's not enough to abſtain from ſin, but a man is to have an eye upon the principle that lyes the reſtraint upon him, what it is; many a man may be kept from ſin for fleſhy aims, as <hi>Haman</hi> refrained himſelf till he came home, and ſo King <hi>Joaſh</hi> during all the days of <hi>Jehoiada:</hi> the fear of man will reſtrain luſt many times, where there is no fear of God.

And ſo it is alſo as to reſtraint from ſin, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. <hi>They ſhall fear the Lord and his goodneſs:</hi> Heb. 12.29. <hi>Let us have grace to ſerve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear, for our God is a conſuming fire.</hi>

The Attributes of God are nothing elſe but the tranſcendent perfections that are in God, the Divine Nature ſhadowed forth to us according to the capacity of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in which the Lord as in his back parts, that is, <hi>pro noſtro modulo, according to our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,</hi> makes known himſelf unto us, and cauſes his goodneſs to paſs before us; and if the Lord would take any ſoul of us, as he did <hi>Moſes,</hi> and in this manner diſcover himſelf, there is nothing in the world would affect the ſoul like unto it; for if theſe be the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of God, how infinitely muſt they needs exceed all things that are in the creatures? for they are all in him after the manner of a God, and therefore all the attributes may be predicated of God <hi>in abſtracto;</hi> he is Wiſdom, and Holineſs, and Mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe they are all of them the Divine Nature: all the excellencies that are in the creature are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from him; and therefore ſurely there is infinite more in himſelf.

How comes it to paſs, that all things are yours, and promiſes yours? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but becauſe the Lord is our God; and therefore it's brought in as the foundation of all bleſſedneſs, having ſpoken of all creature-comforts in the higheſt, he adds this,<note place="margin">Pſal. 144.</note> 
                     <hi>Bleſſed are the people that are in ſuch a caſe, yea bleſſed are the people whoſe God is the Lord.</hi> There is a bleſſedneſs therein without the creatures, and the only foundation of bleſſedneſs in the creatures lyes in this. (1) In creatures; conſider this is the difference between the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of godly men and wicked men, they may both poſſeſs the ſame thing, but with a different temper, and the one has only a title unto creatures, as a gift of God, but the other, as he has a title unto God; the one has them by a ſingle, and the other by a double title; and ſo a little that the righteous has, is better than great riches of many wicked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has all that he has conveyed unto him from his intereſt in God, as the Original thereof. (2) In promiſes; it's true that their inheritance in them is very glorious, far beyond that of <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, but yet the foundation of all the promiſes is an attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, and they muſt all lead the ſoul unto God, and his intereſt in him that did promiſe; for <hi>Faithful is he that has promiſed, and he will alſo do it.</hi> There is a promiſe of pardon of ſin, but ſtill it is to be reſolved into an attribute,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.1.</note> 
                     <hi>He is faithful and juſt that forgives us our ſins.</hi> As all the precepts of the Law are to be reſolved at laſt into the authority of the Law-giver, ſo all the promiſes of the Goſpel are to be reſolved into the power and faithfulneſs of him that made the promiſe; ſo that every promiſe is but a line to lead the ſoul into this centre, firſt unto Chriſt, unto whom the promiſes were firſt made, and through Chriſt unto God who made the promiſes. It's full of ſweetneſs, when a man can look upon all the creatures in the world, and can ſay all things are mine, all ſhall work together for my good; when he can look into the precepts and promiſes of the Word, and can ſay, I have claimed it as mine inheritance for ever, for it is the joy of my heart; but much more when the ſoul can look upon the attributes of God, which are as far above creatures and promiſes, as the Heaven is above the Earth, in compariſon, and can claim a propriety in theſe alſo; and therefore it's the Motto of the Saints, <hi>Tolle Deum, &amp; nullus ero, Take away God, and I am nothing.</hi> If I had all the creatures in the world, and all the promiſes in the Word, yet if I have no intereſt in God, all theſe could be no good to me.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It's the laſt refuge of the Saints in this life: <hi>The name of the Lord is a ſtrong tower,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 18.10.</note> and his name is his attributes, called <hi>the Memorial of God;</hi> it's the property of men to flye to the city of refuge that is next unto them, and at hand, and therefore in danger the Saints are apt to betake themſelves unto creatures, and think that their mountain ſhall ſtand ſtrong; but then God breaks all their hopes and expectation in the creatures, and the mans proviſion proves to be made of ſnow, and it melts away;<note place="margin">Eſay 66.11.</note> and being thus beaten off from creatures, now the Saints betake themſelves unto promiſes, and they ſuck theſe breaſts of conſolation. But when the ſoul looks upon himſelf, and finds his unſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:52030:160"/> unto them and his title but baffled, he can find no ſweetneſs in them; now unto what ſhall the ſoul flye? it comes to Attributes, and under them it ſits down ſecurely, and can rejoyce in the Lord when creatures fail;<note place="margin">Hab. 3.18, 19.</note> and when a man has not a promiſe that his ſoul can pitch upon, yet he can ſay, <hi>The Lord, the Lord merciful and gracious:</hi> and from thence, though he hath not a promiſe, yet he can gather as it were a <hi>half-promiſe,</hi> and that is, <hi>who knows if he will return and repent,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.14. The Lord in this doth delight to train up the ſoul to an immediate dependence, and therefore doth often reduce a man unto ſuch extremities, that he may ſee the foundation upon which all his mercy is built; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as he deals with comforts and ſigns in reference unto Chriſt, ſo he deals with crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and promiſes in reference unto God. Now God gives unto his people the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the promiſe, and ſigns of his grace, to refreſh them in their way, that they may be unto them as grapes in the wilderneſs; but yet he will ſometimes hide the conſolations of his Spirit, and withdraw his light, and ſometimes will hide the light of a mans own gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from him, on purpoſe that a man may flye unto Chriſt, and ſee that it is in him only that we hold them, and from him we muſt fetch them alſo; the Lord will let his people enjoy the comfort of promiſes and of creatures, but ſometimes he will turn away from us as it were the comfort of them both, that our ſouls may retire unto him alone, in whom our happineſs and comfort doth conſiſt; ſo that a man that has for many years walked in the light of Gods countenance, and enjoyed the aſſurance of his love, yet ſhall be brought unto acts of recumbency again, and to lanch out into the fulneſs that is in Chriſt, and the all-ſufficiency that is in God, as if he were to begin all anew; and therefore <hi>Bernard, de Amore Dei cap.</hi> 2. has ſuch an excellent ſpeech of himſelf, who did daily ſtrive to ſee his intereſt in God: <hi>Manibus pedibúſ<expan>

Now in ſuch withdrawments, <hi>bleſſed is the man whoſe God is Jehovah;</hi> and in the failing of all the reſt of his comforts, yet he can reſt and ſtay his ſoul upon this Rock of Ages.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This ſhall be the only happineſs of the Saints in glory, when this promiſe ſhall be perfectly fulfilled; for there will come a time when both creatures and promiſes ſhall ceaſe, for the earth and all the works thereof ſhall be burnt up, when the Heavens do ſhrivel together as a ſcroll, and then the good things of thy life-time will take their leave for ever; for God did but ſet up the ſtage of this world to be as the wilderneſs through which the Saints ſhould paſs into <hi>Canaan;</hi> but the ſtage of this world ſhall be taken down, and all the promiſes of God ſhall come to an end, for they ſhall all of them ſpeak in their due time, and not lye: there is a time for the finiſhing of the whole My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of God;<note place="margin">Rev. 10.7.</note> and the Decrees of God ſhall bring forth in mercy, or in wrath, and the promiſes ſhall be delivered of all the bleſſings that are in them, and the threatnings ſhall be eaſed of all the plagues that are in them. Now when both theſe inheritances ſhall ceaſe, what has a Saint then to live upon? Now he has a higher inheritance, and that is of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes; for then God ſhall be all in all, and in him alone ſhall the happineſs of the creature conſiſt;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.28.</note> and it is obſervable, that then our perfect happineſs begins in God, when creatures and promiſes are come to an end; and therefore the ſoul that has his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in him, can take his leave with delight of all creature-comforts, as never to have uſe of them more, as <hi>Elijah</hi> did part with his mantle when he was taken up into Heaven, becauſe they ſee that it ſhall be infinitely made up in God, though it come not in in this low way, as it did unto his people in times paſt, ſuitable to their low eſtate, while they walked as ſervants upon the earth.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Creatures and promiſes could never make a man happy, if a mans intereſt in them were never ſo clearly diſcovered to him; for it could never put his ſoul into a fruition of the chiefeſt good, it would only make all to be faith, and we ſhould rejoyce in the hope of the glory of God;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.9.</note> and it is true, that this is a joy unſpeakable and glorious, <hi>Fruitio eſt actus voluntatis circa finem, &amp; importat quietationem &amp; delectationem anima in amato, Fruition is an act of the will about the end, and it imports the quietation and delectation of the ſoul in its beloved.</hi> Medin.

                  <p n="1">1. If a man had all the creatures armed againſt him for his deſtruction, as all men out of Covenant have, for the Creation groans under their ſervice, that is the bondage of corruption ſpoken of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21. but alſo they are very ready to make war upon thee; for when a man is taken into Covenant with God, there is a league made with the beaſts of the earth, the ſtones of the field, and the creeping things of the ground, <q>And God will hear the Heavens, and the Heavens ſhall hear the Earth,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 2.21.</note> and the Earth ſhall hear the corn, and the wine and the oyl, and they ſhall hear Jezreel; and I will ſow her unto me in the earth, and will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> All the creatures ſhall work together for their good; and yet if God arm the meaneſt of the creatures againſt a man, they ſhall deſtroy him. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the great King of <hi>Egypt</hi> that durſt preſume to war againſt God, cannot contend with Flyes, nor with the Lice and the Frogs, he cannot fight a pitcht battel with the waves. Now if a man cannot ſtand out a battel with the ſmalleſt of the creatures, how can he fight againſt God?

For as this is the great comfort of the Saints, and their laſt refuge, ſo it's the great terrour unto wicked men, and their laſt deſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider if it were but a threatning, what a miſerable thing it is to lye under any evil aſpect thereof: the Lord has ſpread out the <hi>Expanſum</hi> of his Word over the rational world, and the Lord rules all by it, and according to it he will judge them all,<note place="margin">Zac. 1.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Did not my word overtake your fathers?</hi> for the Decree will ſurely bring forth, it will not always carry the judgment in the womb of it; and if it be ſo terrible a thing to be under the power of any one threatning of God,<note place="margin">Zeph. 2.2.</note> what is it to lye under the evil aſpect of all the threatnings of God; that there is not a word in this book but ſpeaks terrour unto the man? much more under the evil aſpects of all the Attributes of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:52030:161"/> in his mercy, he is not the God of thy mercy, and his patience and long-ſuffering thou haſt no claim to; but all theſe Attributes ſhall joyn alſo with Juſtice in their pleas againſt thee: what is there that can ſtand in the way to hinder the fulneſs of wrath from falling on ſuch a ſoul?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The perfection of this miſery thou wilt never know, till thou comeſt unto Hell, as the fulneſs of this promiſe can never be known by the Saints till they come to Heaven: here you may enjoy your inheritance in creatures and promiſes, but thou that art a Saint ſhalt enter one day upon the inheritance of Attributes more fully than can be enjoyed here, there where they all ſhall be ſet forth gloriouſly for thee, in their full luſtre, to make thee happy in the Lord: ſo alſo it ſhall be a mans utmoſt miſery when he comes to Hell, that all the Attributes of God ſhall be in his utmoſt extremity turned againſt him for ever, and thou ſhalt know God to be perfectly an enemy unto thee, and all that is in God; as he is the God of his people, all that is in him is for them, ſo all that is in him is againſt thee. And then every Attribute ſhall act to the full for ever. Here in this life Juſtice doth not act its utmoſt, and God does not ſtir up all his wrath; there is by the Kingdom of Chriſt not only a benefit comes upon all the creatures, for they all ſtand and continue in their being by it; but there is a ſuſpenſion upon the workings of all the Attributes of God towards wicked men, that though they have an evil eye at them from day to day, as 'tis ſaid, <hi>God is angry with the wicked every day,</hi> yet he does not immediately break forth againſt them; but when the Kingdom ſhall be given up unto God the Father, and God ſhall be all in all, this reſtraint upon the Attributes in the actings of them ſhall ceaſe, and every Attribute ſhall have its perfect work againſt thee for ever, and then he will ſhew his power upon the veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction.</p>

As we are not the fountain of our own grace, but it is laid up in Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.11.</note> and we can expect that all the grace that is in Chriſt ſhall be put forth anſwerably unto our neceſſity in the ſeaſon of it, and therefore our grace ſhall abound as our trials and occaſions do increaſe; for ſuitable unto them ſhall our ſupplies of the Spirit be, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.19. ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>For I know that this ſhall turn to my ſalvation through your prayer, and the ſupply of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> So the fountain of all our happineſs is not in our ſelves, but in our God; and all the attributes that are in him, ſhall be managed and put forth for us, as our neceſſity ſhall require, according to the Love, Wiſdom, and Faithfulneſs of a God; ſo that if thou couldſt ſtand in need of infinite wiſdom, and infinite power, and grace, and mercy, all of them ſhould be put forth and exerciſed for thee; not only a conſpiracy and combination of all the creatures, but alſo of all the Attributes of God, all of them ſhall work together for thy good.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Is not this a mighty ground of aſſurance, that all the creatures ſhall be given you, and that the Lord here will deny you nothing that may be for your good? He that gives the greater, will he deny the leſſer? He that makes over all that is in himſelf, will he deny any thing that is in any of his works? Surely it was a good ſaying of <hi>Bernard,</hi> for the things of this life, <hi>Qui dabit regnum, non dabit viaticum?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He that gives a Kingdom, will he not give a viatick or livelihood?</hi> And alſo of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, He that ſpared not his Son, ſhall he not with him freely give us all things?</hi> There is a higher inheritance, a greater gift of God, than giving Chriſt as our Mediator, which is this, in giving us himſelf, that is the Fountain of it. Now if it be a good argument that he will deny us nothing that may be for our good, he that gives the greater, will he deny the leſs? He has given us his Son; much more becauſe he has given us himſelf will he give us all things. Every wiſe Builder doth build anſwerably unto the foundation; he doth not lay a foundation of Marble, and ſet upon it a mud-wall, and cover it with a roof of ſtraw. Now the Lord that has laid ſo glorious a foundation as this in the giving of himſelf, ſurely he hath thought nothing too much or too dear for the Saints. O! what heart can but admire his love! The love of the giver may be ſeen in a very ſmall gift; and ſo there is unto the Saints peculiar love ſeen even in temporal favours,<note place="margin">Chryſanthes.</note> a ſmall token may be <hi>magni amoris indicium, an argument of great love;</hi> but much more the greatneſs of love is ſeen in the greatneſs of the gift. Now of all other this is the greateſt; and therefore to diſtruſt God for mercies and bleſſings of an inferiour nature, of meat and drink, deliverance and preſervation, it is the moſt unworthy thought that can enter into the heart of a Saint; for if the Lord hath, like a God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed himſelf, it is a principle of the baſeſt unbelief and jealouſie of ſpirit to doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will not beſtow all things elſe.</p>

                     <hi>not as he is, but as he wills.</hi> In the opening hereof there are theſe particulars to be ſpoken to. (1) <hi>That all the happineſs that the Saints ſhall have for ever is nothing elſe but a fruit of the promiſe, which they have here a right unto.</hi> (2) <hi>That their portion lyes in the very Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God.</hi> (3) <hi>The manner how this becomes happineſs unto them, and that is by way of Viſion.</hi> (4) <hi>The nature of this Viſion, as it conduces unto happineſs, is to be opened alſo, and how the creature can be ſaid to ſee God in his Eſſence, or as he is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>All the happineſs that the Saints ſhall have in Glory for ever, is nothing elſe but that which is in the promiſes here made over to them. Godlineſs has the promiſe of the life that now is,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.8.</note> 
                     <hi>and that which is to come,</hi> and therefore the life to come and all the glory and happineſs of it is in nothing elſe but a fruit of the promiſe,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.12.</note> and ſo the Saints are ſaid <hi>through faith and patience to inherit the promiſes:</hi> and therefore eternal life is ſaid to be promiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world began: ſo that eternal life is but a fruit of the promiſe,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.2.</note> and Heaven is but a promiſed inheritance; though it's true, that refers unto a promiſe made unto Chriſt, and not unto us; for a purpoſe there might be concerning us before we were, but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe doth ſuppoſe the partie to whom it is made ſubſiſting. This promiſe therefore was made unto Chriſt as repreſenting our perſons, as ſtanding in our ſtead, as being our ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, one that received a Covenant and a promiſe for us; and therefore Heaven is a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which he has promiſed unto them that love him <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.5. and ſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.12. and this is the promiſe that the Lord has ſhewed us, even eternal life.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.25.</note> Hence there is a double diſtinction that is commonly uſed by our Divines.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Saints have a double right to Heaven. There is (1) <hi>Jus ad rem, a right to the thing;</hi> as an Heir has to his Land in his nonage, which as yet he enjoys not, becauſe he is not meet for it, he is not able to manage it, and therefore is under <hi>Tutors</hi> and under <hi>Guardians,</hi> till the time appointed by the Father: and ſo it is with the Saints till they be made meet, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. (2) There is <hi>jus in re,</hi> when a man has a right to it as being in poſſeſſion of it. It's true that we have not ſo a right to Heaven, becauſe we look on it but
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:52030:164"/> by an eye of faith,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.7.</note> and <hi>we rejoyce in the hope of the glory of God,</hi> Rom. 5. and <hi>it is by faith that we walk, and not by ſight,</hi> and that argues that we have not the thing in poſſeſſion, but in expectation only; but when we come to poſſeſs it, it is none other but what in the promiſe we had a right to: it is the <hi>fiducial viſion</hi> that we have of God in this life, that (as it prepares the ſoul, ſo alſo) gives us an intereſt in the beatifical viſion, which is only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the life to come.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Divines ſay, That the Saints have a threefold title unto Heaven and Glory in this life, (1) <hi>in pretio, as there is a purchaſe made;</hi> for Heaven is as well a purchaſed poſſeſſion as any thing that we do injoy in this life. There are two things in the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, there is <hi>debitum legale, a legal debt,</hi> ſo he paid the old debt; and there is <hi>ſuperlegale meritum, a ſuperlegal merit,</hi> and ſo he made a new purchaſe; anſwerable unto the two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits by Chriſt which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7, 14. we have by him <hi>redemption</hi> and an <hi>inheritance,</hi> &amp;c. (2) The Saints have another title, and that is <hi>jus promiſſionis, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe:</hi> for it is a promiſe intailed upon them, as it was made unto Chriſt before the world began. Eternal life is made firſt unto him, and it is that which he himſelf doth glory in, <hi>thou ſhalt ſhew me the path of life,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>in thy preſence is fulneſs of joy, and at thy right hand are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for evermore.</hi> And by virtue of the ſame Covenant and promiſe the Saints do claim eternal life, that Jeſus the Mediator of the Covenant did, though it belong unto him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily, and unto them only in his right, and at ſecond hand. (3) They have a title <hi>in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiis, in the firſt-fruits,</hi> as they have received the firſt-fruits of the Spirit: So <hi>Iſrael</hi> had unto <hi>Canaan,</hi> God did give them a promiſe many hundred years before, but yet they were ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers unto their own inheritance that the Lord had promiſed them, and many of them dyed in faith, not having received the promiſe, as <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs did; but when the Lord had once brought them into the borders of the land, and they had taſted the grapes of <hi>Eskol,</hi> this gave them a further title, becauſe they had taſted of the good land that the Lord had promiſed them: And ſo it is with the Saints, who have received the firſt-fruits of the Spirit, and in them taſted <hi>that the Lord is gracious:</hi> for the firſt-fruits are a further pledge of the crop; it is called an <hi>Earneſt,</hi> which is a further ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity than barely a promiſe; therefore all the happineſs of the Saints that they ſhall have in Heaven is a fruit of the promiſe; and they do enjoy glory by virtue of the ſame Covenant, that they obtain grace, which is therefore called an everlaſting Covenant, not only becauſe it ſhall never be broken, as a Covenant of ſalt which ſtands for ever, but becauſe the fruit of it is to everlaſting in a mans eternal inheritance.</p>
                  <p n="2">§. 2. <hi>The portion of the Saints lies in the very Eſſence of God,</hi> which will appear to us by theſe demonſtrations.</p>

                     <hi>in faciebus, in thy face is fulneſs of joy,</hi> according to Gods own language, <hi>thou ſhalt ſee my back parts, but my face thou ſhalt not ſee and live:</hi> therefore it is in the face of God that the fulneſs of the joy and the happineſs of the Saints doth conſiſt; for in that the happineſs of Chriſt as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who is our head, doth conſiſt; and when we come to Heaven we have not a happineſs apart from Chriſt, as if he had one happineſs, and we another, for we do <hi>enter into our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters joy,</hi> and 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. it is <hi>ſee him as he is,</hi> that is, not as he does now diſcover himſelf <hi>pro captu humano, according to our capacity,</hi> in a glaſs and in a riddle, rather as he is not than as he is; but we ſhall ſee him with open face, according to his Eſſence, that is, as he is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>ultimate</hi> object of faith is that in which the happineſs of the Saints doth conſiſt, and that which is the higheſt thing in the promiſe, in that doth the glory and the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the creature lye. Now there are many <hi>intermediate objects</hi> of faith, but the ultimate is glory:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.21.</note> So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Who by him do believe in God, that raiſed him up from the dead, and gave him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God.</hi> And the laſt thing in the promiſe is eternal life, and that being once attained, all the promiſes are at an end; therefore it is in the Eſſence of God that eternal happineſs lyes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Without this nothing can make the Saints happy. (1) Nothing in this life can: they have in this life four things: [1] They have glorious <hi>promiſes,</hi> but thoſe are but of an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance to come, and we believe that which we ſee not, and therefore hope for it, for faith and ſight are oppoſed; there is a <hi>fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

[2] Of <hi>graces;</hi> but they are alſo imperfect, becauſe they do not make a mans ſoul perfect;<note place="margin">Heb. 12.24.</note> till a man be actually united unto God the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all happineſs and perfection, he can never be happy: it's true, <hi>Gratia electis infun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur, ut actiones peragant ordinatas ad vitam aeternam, Grace is infuſed into the Elect, that they may perform actions ordinate to life eternal,</hi> as <hi>Aquinas.</hi> But theſe graces have reſpect unto an
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:52030:164"/> eternal reward, they do but make us meet for a further mercy, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. to make us meet for the inheritance of the Saints in light. [3] In <hi>creatures:</hi> a mans happineſs does not conſiſt in them, becauſe they are finite, and the ſoul is ordained to be happy in an infinite good; and therefore when a man ſhall be made happy by going to Heaven to enjoy God, he doth take his leave of the creatures; they were his inheritance in his way, and were to him a viatick, but afterwards God ſhall be all in all, and a man goes to God with joy,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> and is glad to ſee the Moon under his feet; ſo the Saints of God in this life continue ſtill longing for their future happineſs. [4] There is an inheritance of <hi>Attributes;</hi>

                     <hi>then that which is in part ſhall be done away:</hi> and this is after a ſort a mans happineſs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the School-men do diſtinguiſh between <hi>beatitudo ſubjectiva &amp; objectiva, ſubjective and objective beatitude.</hi> There is a bleſſedneſs in us, which doth conſiſt in the perfection of grace in the man, (for glory is nothing but grace perfected) and that haply is the meaning of <hi>the ſouls of juſt men made perfect,</hi> that is, their graces are perfected in them,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> and what is lacking in any of them is ſupplied, that which is in part is done away; and this doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed wonderfully perfect the ſoul, but grace perfected is but a creature (though it be the new creature,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.17.</note> and <hi>we are Gods workmanſhip created in Chriſt unto good works</hi>) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath but a finite good, that can never make the ſoul of man happy, which was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for an infinite good.

                  <p n="4">4. It will appear from the nature of bleſſedneſs, that nothing can make the creature bleſſed but the Eſſence of God, and that will appear in three things.

(2) There is nothing can make a man happy but that which makes him <hi>impeccable;</hi> becauſe the ſoul will ſtill be in fear ſo long as he is a ſinner. <hi>Adam</hi> had a <hi>poſſe non peccare, a power not to ſin,</hi> but that did not make him happy; there muſt be a <hi>non poſſe peccare, an impoſſibility of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;</hi> now this only the viſion and eſſence of God can give: and therefore <hi>Suarez de bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tif.

But (3) this viſion of God, though it ſhall be of his Eſſence, yet not of it unto perfection; for ſo it's infinite, and therefore cannot be perfectly underſtood or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by a finite underſtanding, as that of the creature muſt ſtill be, though it be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. There ſhall be enough unto our perfection, but we ſhall never be able to know God unto his perfection; and therefore the School-men do affirm, that though all the Saints for the ſubſtance of their happineſs ſhall ſee God in his Eſſence as he is, yet <hi>quoad menſuram ex ſola Dei voluntate pendet &amp; ex arbitraria diſpenſatione, as to the meaſure it depends wholly on the Divine Will and his arbitrary diſpenſation.</hi> And this is the ground of the degrees of glory in Heaven, that as there are different diſcoveries of good here, which are the ground of the different degrees of grace here, ſo it ſhall be in glory alſo.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Joh. 3.12.</note>2. Here we know God but by way of <hi>Reſemblance</hi> and <hi>Metaphors</hi> taken from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; he doth ſpeak to us <hi>heavenly</hi> things in an <hi>earthly</hi> manner; he is ſaid to be the <hi>Lord

                  <p n="3">3. They ſhall ſee God as their own, and all the excellencies that are in him as their own portion. It's but a little the Saints do ſee here of God in this life, a ſmall portion is known of him; but yet there is this difference between the ſight of the Saints that they have of God here, and other men, as the Apoſtle ſays,<note place="margin">Col. 1.27.</note> It has been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifeſt to the Saints, to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this myſtery among the Gentiles, which is Chriſt in you the hope of glory. They read it as they do the Scripture as their own evidence; but other men they read over all the myſteries of godlineſs and Heaven, as the evidences of other men, and not as their own portion; they cannot ſay as the Saints do, <hi>Chriſtus in Evangelio tuo meus eſt, Chriſt in thy Goſpel is my Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> to <hi>Marcion.</hi> There is a great difference between a ſtrangers looking upon the glory and excellencies that are in a man, and of his wifes looking upon them; the one looks upon them and admires them, and is affected with them, and will talk of the fine ſight he has ſeen, and there's an end, he lets the diſcourſe fall again, it's not his concern to be thinking of it; ay, but his wife looks upon them with another eye, as being hers, and becauſe ſhe has an intereſt in his perſon, ſhe has a ſetled eſteem of them, and the thought of it is always her contentment. So do the Saints look upon the fulneſs of Chriſt here with delight, and ſo they behold the glory of God with ſatisfaction, for their ſoul ſays unto the Lord, Thou art my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They ſee themſelves in God. There is indeed much of God diſcovered in all the creatures, and yet they are but only <hi>veſtigia Dei, the footſteps of God,</hi> and yet the Saints delight to behold them, becauſe they ſee ſomething of God in them; and the more of God is diſcovered in any creature, or any paſſage of providence, the more their hearts are affected with it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. <hi>When I conſider the heavens the works of thy hands:</hi> it's the ſpeech of Chriſt, he is much affected with the creatures, and the ſight of God in them; but there is more of God diſcovered in the meaneſt Saint, than there is in the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and in the moſt glorious creature. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 'tis ſaid, <hi>They ſhall ſhine as the ſun in the kingdom of their father,</hi> the glory of the Sun is not to be compared unto them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To ſee beauty is a great delight to the eye, but much more for ſouls to ſee their own beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: to ſee the image of God in the Saints here is glorious, and to ſee it in a mans ſelf is more comfortable; much more taking ſhall it be, and more comfortable, to ſee it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after when it ſhall be perfected.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They ſhall ſee all things that concern themſelves in God. <hi>Adam</hi> had a Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his heart, that was the guide of his way; and the Saints have alſo in their hearts a rule, as well as in the book; but the Saints in Heaven have no other book but God, <hi>Beati in Deo vident omnes actiones &amp; circumſtantias ad ſe pertinentes, The bleſſed ſee in God all actions and circumſtances that belong unto them.</hi> This is the book in which they ſhall read lectures in his face for ever, the <hi>Dectatis ſpeculum, the glaſs of the Deity;</hi> as their happineſs ſhall be wholly in God, for God ſhall be all in all; ſo their direction ſhall come from him immediately; and ſo ſhall their conſolation and their acceptation, they ſhall ſee that God is pleaſed with them for ever, whatſoever they put their hands to; and they ſhall be no more in doubt of the rule, and go with their way hid no more; as many of the Saints here walk uncomfortably, becauſe ſometimes their duty is hidden from them, the rule in ſome particular caſes is dark to them, and they droop many times, becauſe they know not what to do, though their eyes be lifted up; yet be of good chear, poor ſoul, it ſhall be otherwiſe when thou comeſt to enjoy this viſion of God in glory.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It ſhall be a viſion that ſhall be everlaſting, we ſhall behold his face for ever: here in this life, in our greateſt diſcoveries of God, there is an interruption, a veil that is drawn between us and our God; and though now we are ſometimes in the light, by and by we walk in darkneſs again; but in Heaven the diſcovery ſhall be perpetual, we ſhall ſee his face, ſo that he will never hide his face from us more, we ſhall never loſe the ſight of God unto eternity; God will never withdraw himſelf from us, for he doth em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace you with everlaſting mercy, and ſin ſhall never interpoſe, or cauſe an Eclipſe.</p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:52030:166"/>
                  <p>This is the extent of this glorious Viſion, which ſhall never be accompliſhed till thou come to glory: here we are to have it in our eye continually, and to exerciſe faith about it; O walk in the hope of it, for here is the happineſs of the Saints; and if the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God that are diſcovered to them, and made over to them be not ſufficient to make them happy, yet ſurely there is enough in the very Eſſence of God himſelf; know he is thy God in Covenant <hi>quantus quantus eſt:</hi> and if there be enough in him to make himſelf happy, ſurely there is enough to make thee happy alſo; and therefore bleſſed is the ſoul whoſe God is Jehovah.</p>

Our eternal happineſs doth conſiſt in viſion, becauſe this is the way by which God doth diſpenſe all things unto us, it being the only way that is agreeable to the rational nature: for as the Lord doth expect that all that comes from us ſhould be reaſonable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>modo naturae rationali proportionato, proportionate to our nature;</hi> ſo all that he doth commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate unto us, he doth it in a rational way: this is the <hi>way of nature,</hi> and this is the <hi>way of grace;</hi> and therefore the Lord will make it to be the way of conveying all things to us in glory.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) This is the <hi>way of Nature:</hi> the will of man is <hi>appetitus rationalis, a rational appetite;</hi> and therefore it can receive nothing, unleſs there be a <hi>Dictamen</hi> of the underſtanding that goes before; and anſwerable to the <hi>Dictamen,</hi> ſuch is the choice and election of the will; and hence come ſuch various impreſſions upon the will, ſometimes there is a good inclination, and a good purpoſe or reſolution, the man is almoſt perſwaded, and by and by the will is off again, becauſe the underſtanding repreſents things otherwiſe, not holding on in its former light: and when there is in the underſtanding an <hi>ultimum dictamen, a laſt dictamen,</hi> then doth the will firmly and conſtantly cloſe; and therefore ſin came in that way; Satan knew that there was no corrupting of the will but by the underſtanding; for an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate acceſs to the will there was not, therefore the woman was deceived, and this <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> lyes in the underſtanding properly. This is the way of nature, there muſt be a light in the underſtanding, and that brings reſolution and election, and all things into the will, and acts it.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) This is the <hi>way of Grace</hi> alſo: the Lord when he will change the will, doth it firſt by a ſpiritual illumination of the underſtanding, and from thence there doth by the power of grace come an effectual determination of the will to embrace that <hi>ultimum dictamen, laſt dictate</hi> of the enlightned underſtanding; and that makes a free and chearful choice of that ſupernatural good, which is to the underſtanding by a ſpiritual and heavenly light diſcovered, and clearly apprehended thereby: there is a teaching that goes with the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44. And ſo it is for all growth and increaſe of grace alſo: for grace is improved in the ſame manner as it is at firſt created; men grow in grace, as they grow in knowledge;<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.18.</note> as the Lord will enlarge the affections, ſo he doth firſt raiſe the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the man.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) Glory being in ſome reſpects but the perfection of the ſame grace (for Divines com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſay, that grace and glory differ but in degrees) therefore the way that the Lord took in the one he doth take the ſame in the other alſo; as he ſanctifies the man <hi>modo connatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali, in a connatural way,</hi> ſo in the ſame way he glorifies him: as it is in this life, viſion doth increaſe grace, and anſwerable to the degrees of viſion, ſuch are the degrees of grace; ſo it's perfect viſion that doth perfect grace: in the ſame way that Satan brought ſin and death into the ſoul,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.14.</note> namely by the underſtanding; for the <hi>woman was deceived,</hi> as it is in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. ſo the ſame way will the Lord bring in grace and life into the ſoul, it comes

                     <hi>and we ſhall know even as we are known.</hi> The oppoſition is between the knowledge that now we have of God, and what we ſhall have hereafter; and they are compared in two things, [1] in <hi>the manner</hi> of knowledge, which ſhall not be the ſame; now we <hi>ſee in a glaſs,</hi> but then immediately we ſhall ſee without a glaſs: but if we ſhould ſee God <hi>per abſtractam imaginem,</hi> (as <hi>Gomer</hi> hath a diſputation of it in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.17. <hi>part</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 328.) though it were the pureſt glaſs, more clear than cryſtal, yet it were ſeeing in a glaſs ſtill, which is wholly denied; we ſhall no more ſee in a glaſs, but face to face. [2] In the <hi>imperfection</hi> of our viſion: we now ſee <hi>darkly,</hi> and the reaſon is from the manner of it, becauſe we ſee in a glaſs; but then it ſhall be perfected, becauſe we ſhall ſee face to face; ſo much is manifeſted to <hi>Moſes, thou ſhalt ſee my back parts:</hi> the Attributes of God are diſcovered here in this life, but there is the face of God diſcovered, which muſt be ſomething beyond what is called his <hi>back parts,</hi> that ſhall be diſcovered to the ſoul,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:52030:167"/> which here he cannot ſee and live, but hereafter he muſt ſee, or he cannot live, therefore there is a viſion of the Divine Eſſence.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) It will appear by reaſon alſo, the chief good of the creature is in God alone, that which is called <hi>Beatitudo objectiva, objective Beatitude,</hi> which doth only ſatisfie and fill the heart of the Saints; and it's in the viſion and fruition thereof that the ſoul reſts. Now any image of God or manifeſtation of God that is created cannot be our objective hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, for theſe are but creatures, as the diſcoveries of God unto the ſoul by the Spirit in a way of Ordinances are; therefore the ſoul can never reſt in them, can never look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as its happineſs; as the Saints receiving here the joy in the Holy Ghoſt, they are exceedingly raviſhed with it, it's joy unſpeakable, <hi>Ego mihi viſus ſum tanquam unus ex illis beatis, I ſeemed to my ſelf as one of thoſe bleſſed ones;</hi> but yet the ſoul is not ſatisfied with it, but when he ſees Gods face <hi>he is ſatisfied with his likeneſs,</hi> that diſcovery that there is of God in his own face, but is never ſatisfied till then.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though we ſhall ſee God in his Eſſence, yet we ſhall not ſee the Eſſence of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to perfection.

(2) <hi>Comprehenſionis, of Comprehenſion,</hi> when a man knows any thing perfectly, <hi>ſecundùm modum cognoſcibilitatis, as it is knowable,</hi> or to the utmoſt that it may be known. Now the Eſſence of God being infinite, cannot be comprehended by any finite underſtanding; even the Angels themſelves cannot know all that is in God; for an infinite Being cannot be known and comprehended but by an infinite underſtanding: <hi>We ſhall know ſo much of Gods Eſſence as will tend unto our perfection, though we cannot find out the Almighty to his perfections.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>meaſure</hi> of the manifeſtation, it depends <hi>ex ſola Dei voluntate &amp; diſpenſatione arbitraria, wholly on Gods pleaſure.</hi> As there are different degrees of grace in this life, and the Lord doth give unto men different degrees of light, according unto the meaſure of grace that he has appointed them unto; ſo he has appointed them alſo to different degrees of glory: ſays Chriſt, <hi>To ſit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to give, but it ſhall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.</hi> As the ſouls that he ſhall ſave are given by the Father, ſo alſo the meaſure of their grace and their glory is appointed by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and anſwerable unto the degrees of glory that they are appointed by the Father, ſuch ſhall be the manifeſtations of God unto them when they come unto glory: therefore as glory is of grace, ſo are the degrees of glory alſo: as here the Lord diſpenſeth divers gifts as he will, ſo he doth in Heaven; ſome have more of the preſence of God and clearer diſcoveries than others have, becauſe it's not by neceſſity of nature, but by an act of the will. And therefore whereas ſome do object we cannot ſee the Eſſence of God perfectly, therefore not at all, becauſe <hi>Eſſentia eſt ſimpliciſſima, moſt ſimple;</hi> and if we ſee the Eſſence of God we muſt ſee all his Attributes, and ſo the knowledge of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and we muſt know as much as God knows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it's true, if God did glorifie his people as a natural Agent, we might conclude he muſt <hi>ad ultimum potentiae, diſcover himſelf to the utmoſt;</hi> but ſeeing he doth it as a voluntary Agent, who acts <hi>certo moderamine, by a certain meaſure,</hi> ſo much of his Eſſence they ſhall know as he will diſcover, and that ſhall be ſo much as is for their perfection, though not to his perfection.</p>

FIrſt ſee here the folly and the miſery of all unregenerate men, who place their happineſs in any thing elſe that is not God, and forſake God, and the happineſs that is to be had in him, for the creatures ſake. 1. See their folly: ſin is never ſeen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, unleſs it be ſeen to be a fooliſh and an unreaſonable thing:<note place="margin">Pſal. 14.1.</note> 
                     <hi>The fool has ſaid in his heart that there is no God,</hi> and this fool is every unregenerate man; and the great folly of a man lies in his utmoſt end, or elſe his great wiſdom; for he that doth erre in that is a fool, though he have all the wiſdom of the world beſide; all his wiſdom without this tends to no other end but to deceive and undo himſelf: and therein doth the wiſdom of a godly man properly conſiſt, that he doth never miſs his utmoſt end, and therein the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Saint is wiſer than all ungodly men, though they may be counted the wiſe men of the world. Conſider</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What a folly is it for a man to frame to himſelf a happineſs? for he that gave him a being, he only can appoint him to an end, he only can preſcribe him a rule; therefore he that will be <hi>faber foelicitatis, the framer of felicity</hi> unto himſelf, he doth make himſelf a God, and create his own Heaven, which will prove but a fools Paradiſe in the end; for God hath appointed for man no other happineſs but in himſelf, in his Eſſence lies his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and without this nothing in this world ſhould ſatisfie, neither doth it a gracious heart that is truly wiſe: <hi>Tua non ſatiunt niſi tecum: omnis copia quae non eſt Deus meus, ege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtas eſt: tolle Deum &amp; nullus ero,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thy good things ſatisfie not unleſs with thy ſelf: All abundance which is not my God is want: Take away God and I ſhall be nothing.</hi> Theſe are the ſpeeches of grace and godlineſs that carry a man directly towards God. Now for a man that is Gods creature to create to himſelf a happineſs and an imaginary Heaven, is the greateſt folly in the world, becauſe it conſiſts only in imagination, the excellency of all things here below as a mans portion being but a fancy only, as the word is <hi>Act.</hi> 25.23. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>with much fancy.</hi> And as a dreaming man that dreams he is full, and when he awakes his ſoul is empty: ſo it is with them on whom the Lord pours out a ſpirit of ſlumber, and though they dream of Heaven, yet they awake in Hell. There are ſeveral ranks of creatures as the Lord has pleaſed to ſet them in the world, all being in his hand, as clay in the hand of the potter. Now a man may as rationally chuſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf another ſhape than God has given him, and degenerate into a beaſt, as chuſe to himſelf another end, and fancy another happineſs and perfection in that condition in which he is created. This is certain, he that will walk by his own rule, and will be his own maſter, he muſt look to be his own Saviour; and he that will appoint to himſelf an end, and will create his own Heaven, muſt expect that ſhall be his Hell in the end.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When you forſake your happineſs in God, you turn unto creatures that have no worth, or ſufficiency in them, and therefore <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.13. they are called <hi>broken ciſterns.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 2.13.</note> (1) They are <hi>ciſterns,</hi> comforts they have none in them, but what they put into them; for a ciſtern has not a ſpring, the water doth not ariſe out of it; what therefore if God put no comfort into the creatures, the ciſtern is but empty, it will have no water; all the comfort that is in the creatures God puts into them, there is none of them can hurt us apart from God, nor comfort us apart from God; and therefore the Saints in all their mercies taſte the love of God, and delight themſelves in his goodneſs, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> acknowledged Gods goodneſs in all his favours from the King. (2) A ciſtern will hold but a little when it's put into it, for it is of a narrow capacity, there is a great deal of difference between the fulneſs in the ciſtern and in the fountain. As it is with the Saints in point of grace, ſo it is with the creatures in point of comfort; the fountain can never be drawn dry, nay the more it is drawn, the quicker the ſprings are, there is never the leſs; and it is moſt true in God, the more a man doth draw happineſs from him, the quicker the returns are, and there is never the leſs in God; for he doth communicate good as the Sun doth light <hi>ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nativè, by way of emanation,</hi> and that muſt needs be without diminution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are but as the Moon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.1. that has but a little light, and that but borrowed, and as ſoon as the Sun turns away its reflexion, its light is darkned, and the Moon is cloathed with ſackcloth, and its light doth not appear. (3) Water in a ciſtern will dye, and loſe its vigour, as we ſee it is in a ſtanding pool, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.19. it's ſaid of the ſervants of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that they digged a well of <hi>living water,</hi> ſo water in the ſpring or fountain is called, but it is not ſo with water in the ciſtern, it will dye and putrifie, and ſtink, and grow noiſom in
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:52030:169"/> the end; creature-comforts will not be comforts always, the good that is in them will not be always ſweet: let but the Lord change the mind of a man, and that which was before ſweet, will be bitter, even the water of gall: take a man that is converted, and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-comforts that before he delighted in are not now pleaſant to him, <hi>dulce eſt iſtis ſuis vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptatibus carere;</hi> and it is ſo to ungodly men alſo when once they are converted, the world paſſeth away and the luſts thereof; ſometimes the creature leaves a man, but the comforts of it will certainly, before a man dyes, and let once the luſt paſs away, a man has no deſire to it, and he finds then no ſatisfaction and contentment in it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.27. <hi>The ſearching out of glory is not glory,</hi> that is, ſearch it to the uttermoſt, and there will never be a ſatiety, it will be glory ſtill; but take the choiceſt and the ſweeteſt contentments in this life, and they will be ſo: a man may eat honey till it will not be honey to him, but prove loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; and ſo a man may in the enjoyment of any creature be nauſeated, and his ſoul may loath that which before was dainty meat; but in God it is not ſo, the comforts that there are to be had in him are always freſh, living, and vigorous; for they are in him as water is in a fountain. (4) If God put into the creatures any comfort, it is but into <hi>ciſterns that are broken,</hi> and they'l leak out, they cannot hold them long; for ſin hath made a crack in all the creatures, that as faſt as God puts comfort into them, they do leak them out again:<note place="margin">Heb. 2.1.</note> as it's in reference to the Word of God, we prove leaking veſſels, and let the things ſlip from us that we have heard; ſo do the comforts alſo of the creatures that God gives us, in reference to all the ſweetneſs and comfort that is put into them by God. If a man have an Eſtate, he <hi>puts it into a bag with holes;</hi> when a man hath gotten it, all his care will not keep the comfort of it long; for there is a vanity by ſin come upon all the creatures, they are blaſted quickly. It's true that in the Creation they were but ciſterns, and it was but little that they could hold, a mans great comfort and ſatisfaction came not in by them, they were made to be his ſervants, but not his portion to enjoy; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by ſin there is a vanity put into the creatures, that though they may ſatisfie a while, yet their comfort will quickly be gone, as they themſelves will: for the world paſſes away, and the faſhion of it, and it is but a faſhion and an outſide, and no more.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If you place your happineſs in any thing elſe, you do but forſake God: other things may be enjoyed in ſubordination to God, yet ſo as your Heaven muſt be in him alone; but they muſt not come in competition with God, for he will be God alone. When <hi>Parmenio</hi> made the motion to <hi>Alexander</hi> to accept the terms that <hi>Darius</hi> did offer, and perſwaded the King to it, he told him the Heavens could have but one Sun: and ſurely the heart of man can have but one God, there can be but one laſt end, one chief good. Now as a man that doth not ſell all cannot buy the Pearl, for it is to be had at no other price, as ſays Chriſt,<note place="margin">Luk. 14.33.</note> 
                     <hi>He that forſakes not all that he has, cannot be my Diſciple,</hi> all things are to be forſaken, not only as an oblation, but as a condition, without which Chriſt is not to be had: ſo it is alſo in this,<note place="margin">Jonah 2.8.</note> he that will have his portion in God muſt have no other God, <hi>they that obſerve lying vanities forſake their own mercy,</hi> the word doth ſignifie <hi>to keep</hi> alſo, as of <hi>Jacobs</hi> keeping of ſheep, taking care of them as his charge, that none of them were loſt or did miſcarry; and ſo men do <hi>keep lying vanities,</hi> their great care is over them, that they loſe them not, that their Idols be not taken away from them. And ſo <hi>Proſper</hi> alſo ſays, of all thoſe things in which men place their happineſs, <hi>labore quaerunt, cura ſervant, &amp; anxiâ delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione poſſident, they ſeek them with labour, keep them with care, and poſſeſs them with anxious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation.</hi> And it's uſed for the <hi>moſt heedful obſervation, Pſal.</hi> 130. and thus it is with a great deal of heed, care, and induſtry that men preſeve their Idols. So all theſe things that we are ſo careful of, they are but <hi>lying vanities,</hi> or the <hi>vanity of a lye;</hi> to ſhew the emptineſs of them they are called vanities in the abſtract in the Plural, which is ordinary with the Hebrews to do: though they are nothing but emptineſs, yet they are ſuch vanities as carry that curſe with them, that they do raiſe a mans expectation, and he believes great things from them, and by that means they become a <hi>lye;</hi> and therefore <hi>men of low degree are vanity,</hi>

                     </note> why, he doth by <hi>obſerving theſe but forſake his own mercy,</hi> that is, that mercy which is offered to them, and might become their own; had not they neglected it by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving lying vanities, it might have been truly their own; whereas none of the things that they ſo obſerve could be; for it is but this worlds goods, if <hi>we are not faithful in that which is another mans,</hi>

The Lord did make himſelf to be the portion of his people, and he created all ſouls capable of ſo high a happineſs and glory as himſelf and his own Eſſence; for they are all created for the enjoyment of God himſelf: other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:52030:170"/> were created to enjoy a good within the compaſs of their own nature, and therein did their perfection conſiſt; but man was created to enjoy a good above his own nature, and in his enjoyment of it he was to be perfected, and ſo long as he falls ſhort of this, he falls ſhort of his perfection; therefore when ſouls come to Heaven, and enjoy God in his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, they are called <hi>Souls made perfect;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12.23.</note> and all other perfections that men have are grounded upon this, and do flow from it, namely the perfection of their faculties, graces, and comforts. Now of this capacity all the ſouls of men were created; there is not the wickedeſt man in the world, even ſuch as periſh for ever, but they have ſouls created ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of God, and of a happineſs in his Eſſence, and they can be happy no other way.

But the recompence of the Saints reward lies in God himſelf, when he will take from them all the good things that they enjoy below, and all that communion which they enjoyed here with him, where they ſee his back parts, there they ſhall ſee his face for ever, and therefore it's beyond the hopes and the expectation of the Saints:<note place="margin">

(2) <hi>Poena ſenſus,</hi> which is ſomething poſitive, a puniſhment inflicted by God immediately upon ſoul and body. But it's ſaid commonly by Divines, that it's the firſt that is the greateſt part of a mans torment, and it's that which makes Hell properly ſuch, which is demonſtrated (1) from the meritorious cauſe of it, which is ſin. There are in the Law two things, [1] the <hi>precept,</hi> [2] the <hi>prohibition.</hi> Now the mind of the Law-giver was moſt in the precept, and therefore the omiſſion is a greater offence than the commiſſion, if they be apart conſidered: now the puniſhment of loſs is proportioned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the omiſſion of the precept, as the puniſhment of ſenſe is unto the commiſſion of the ſin.

(1) The Devils miniſtery ſhall laſt no longer than the time of the miniſtery of good Angels, and that ſhall be but for the time of this life; for Satan ſhall be the God of this world no more after this life, and the good Angels ſhall be Principalities and Powers no more; for all rule and all autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhall be put down, whether good or evil; and therefore what power ſoever Satan has over wicked men while they are here (for he works effectually in them) he ſhall have no power over them hereafter. (2) The Devil himſelf being the greateſt in ſin, ſhall be the deepeſt in torment; for Hell is prepared chiefly for the Devil and his Angels. Now who ſhall torment the Devils? who can have power over them? this muſt be by God imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, it muſt be done by his own hand: Therefore man being appointed to partake with the Devil in the ſame torment, and by the ſame fire, look what it is that torments the Devil, that alſo muſt be the torment of thoſe that in a way of ſinning have given themſelves unto him.

There is unto the Saints all things in God; therefore when the Lord deſires to give unto his people full aſſurance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17. as if he were in diſpute about it, it's ſaid, <hi>When he could ſwear by no greater, he ſwore by himſelf,</hi> as if the Lord had been ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous about it, and ſo deſirous to give a man ground of fulneſs of aſſurance, that if there had been a greater, God would have ſworn by it; but becauſe there was no greater, he ſwore by himſelf: and ſo it's here in this particular alſo, the Lord is deſirous to ſhew his Love unto his Saints to the utmoſt, and Love is mainly ſeen in the bounty of it. Now if there had been a greater gift than himſelf he would have beſtowed it; but becauſe there was no greater he gave himſelf, and made over his own Eſſence to them: which is not only a ſtrong ground of aſſurance that you ſhall be happy (for he is the bleſſed God, and his bleſſedneſs lies in himſelf, and he is his own bleſſedneſs) but that he ſhall accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the poſſibility of the creature become thy happineſs alſo; and it's a ſure ground, that he that gives himſelf will deny nothing that may conduce to bring thee unto that glorious end, which is the viſion of Gods own Eſſence, in which the height of his Love and of thy happineſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

[1] God the Father has made over himſelf, I will be unto him a Father, it's ſpoken of Chriſt; and therefore he is called by the Apoſtle the God and Father of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by this means he is our Father, my Father, and your Father, <hi>my God and your God,</hi> ſay Chriſt.<note place="margin">Joh. 20.

Which is not to be interpreted as a promiſe only of the gifts and graces of the Spirit to come in but at ſecond hand: but as the giving of the Son is a giving of his perſon, and giving us an intereſt therein; ſo giving the Spirit is a giving of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Spirit alſo, and giving us a perſonal intereſt in him: and as the Father and Son
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:52030:173" rendition="simple:additions"/> are one, ſo is the Spirit alſo one with them; and therefore has the ſame will with them, and doth freely beſtow himſelf upon the Saints for their portion, as the Son doth to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the great deſigns of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This will appear from the union of a Saint with all the Perſons in the Trinity. The Scripture ſpeaks diſtinctly,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.17.</note> not only of a union with Chriſt, but with the Spirit, <hi>he that is joyned unto the Lord is one ſpirit, i. e.</hi> not only makes up one ſpiritual body with him, but alſo is one with the Spirit that dwells in him; and therefore <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21.

                     <hi>as we are one:</hi> not only one amongſt themſelves, but <hi>one with us</hi> alſo, according unto that glorious and unſpeakable union that is between the perſons amongſt themſelves, of which this is but a ſhadow and a reſemblance. God is ſaid to <hi>dwell in the Saints,</hi> and they are <hi>the habitation of God through the Spirit,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. and they are ſaid to dwell in God, <hi>Joh,</hi> 1.4, 16. and 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.1. <hi>which is in God the Father,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>to work in God, Joh.</hi> 3.21. And our Divines do commonly ſay, that in glory our union with God ſhall be perfected; and they ſay, that the ſoul is capable of an union with God, as it does appear in its union with the Son; for the myſtical union is not only unto Chriſt as Man, but unto the Godhead, as well as unto the Manhood of Chriſt; for we are made one with whole Chriſt both God and Man. Now by this means there being but one Eſſence, there muſt follow a glorious union with all the Perſons, and if this be perfected (as ſome make that to be the intent of Chriſts prayer, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21. <hi>That they may be one with us, as thou Father art in me</hi>) if there be a perfection of their union hereafter, then ſurely there is an union that is begun in this life with all the perſons in the Godhead; and ſo much alſo our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular union with them does imply, for all communion is grounded in union.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It will appear from the diſtinct Communion of the Saints with them all: <hi>Our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is with the Father and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.3.</note> And there is a fellowſhip of the Spirit alſo,<note place="margin">Joh. 14.21.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. (1) There are diſtinct manifeſtations: Chriſt ſays, <hi>I will manifeſt my ſelf to him;</hi> and there is a diſtinct Love, <hi>He that loves me ſhall be loved of my Father. I do not ſay that I will pray the Father, for the Father himſelf loves you; and he that loveth me ſhall be loved of my Father alſo:</hi> and therefore there is the love of the Son diſcovered, and the love of the Father alſo. Sometimes the love and good will of the one is let into the Soul, and ſometimes of another; and the ſoul is drawn out and raviſhed ſometimes with the love of the one, and ſometimes with the love of another: and we honour them diſtinctly, and believe in them diſtinctly, <hi>honour the Son, as they honour the Father,</hi> and <hi>believe in God, believe alſo in me, Joh.</hi> 14.1. Anſwerable unto the manifeſtations and diſcoveries that are made, ſuch are the apprehenſions and the affections of the Saints. Some are mightily at firſt converſion taken up with the love of the Father, and they ſee that Chriſt was but his ſervant in that work, and the fountain of free grace was in the Father, and the plot to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem was his, and it was his will that Chriſt came to perform, and therefore their hearts and faith are mainly drawn out towards God the Father. Others there be that have the love of Chriſt ſet on upon their hearts, who though he were God, and in the form of God, and thought it no robbery to be equal with God, yet he did empty himſelf, and humbled himſelf unto death, even the death of the Croſs; and he came off freely upon the motion of the Father, which was ſo much the more, becauſe all the acts of the Father, though they are acts of Love, yet are acts of Majeſty alſo, and there was no diſhonour or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion in the Father; but the acts of Chriſt were acts of miniſtery and of humiliation, and that even unto the death of the Croſs, that he ſhould be made ſin, and made a curſe; and the Love of Chriſt is diſcovered unto them as paſſing knowledge. There are diſtinct manifeſtations of them all, and therein is the ground of their communion with them all. (2) There are diſtinct communications, the Father opens his boſom, and he reveals his counſels. There is a book in the right hand of him that ſits upon the Throne, he reveals his mind unto Chriſt,<note place="margin">Joh. 1.18. Joh. 6.46.</note> and by him unto his Saints; and therefore he is ſaid <hi>to come out of the boſom of the Father,</hi> and therefore man is ſaid <hi>to hear and learn of the Father:</hi> and the Son communicates his righteouſneſs, his graces, his victories, his priviledges, his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the Spirit doth convey unto the ſoul his right and his warmth (for the Spirit is as fire) his holineſs and his comforts, for he is the <hi>oyl of gladneſs;</hi> his communion doth conſiſt in giving and receiving and returning. Now there is ſomething that all the Saints do receive from each of the perſons, and there is a peculiar glory that they do return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them all, anſwerable unto the mercies that they do receive; and by this means propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable unto the mercies they receive, ſuch is the communion that the Saints have, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with one perſon, and ſometimes with another; they know that he that has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Father has communion with the Son and with the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe they are one; but my meaning is, that perſon which a mans heart is at the preſent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with, and drawn out unto in a more ſpecial manner, that he has a ſpecial communion
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:52030:173" rendition="simple:additions"/> with, which is ſomething of the Love of the Father, and the manifeſtation and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Father, ſometimes of the Son, and ſometimes of the Spirit, and anſwerable unto theſe our communion is ſaid to be with each of them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It will appear by theſe diſtinct acts of office which they have for the good of the Saints undertaken; for though <hi>opera ad extrà ſunt indiviſa,</hi> and we cannot ſay that one works, but the other works alſo; and therefore we cannot call them <hi>opera propria, proper works;</hi> yet they are <hi>appropriata, appropriated,</hi> in the Scripture they are more ſpecially attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted ſome unto one, and ſome to another. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>Bleſſed be God the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who has choſen us in him before the foundation of the world, and bleſſed us with all ſpiritual mercies in Chriſt:</hi> and for Chriſt, we have Redemption through his blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and as for the Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13, 14. <hi>After you believed you were ſealed with the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of promiſe, who is the earneſt of your inheritance.</hi> And ſo 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Elect according to the fore-knowledge of God, through the ſanctification of the Spirit, and the ſprinkling of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> therefore by reaſon of the ſpecial intereſt that they have given unto the Saints in themſelves, they have undertaken diſtinct offices; and this is plain in Son and Spirit, which are terms of office. He that is ſent doth imply as much as to be imployed in the buſineſs of another, and to receive his commiſſion from another. This will appear, (1) in the work of Converſion and Election, the Father begets, calls, draws: <hi>For no man</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>can come to me, except God the Father draws him.</hi> Chriſt he receives men, but he receives none but thoſe that the Father has given him, he gives him the ſouls that he muſt ſave, and they that come to him are ſo given him of the Father, theſe ſhall come, and none elſe, <hi>he will in no wiſe caſt them off.</hi> And as Chriſt receives them, ſo the Spirit unites God and the ſoul; for he is the bond of union between them and their Head, <hi>he that is joyned unto the Lord is one Spirit;</hi> and we are one Spirit, baptized into one body; and therefore in the work of Election each of them have their diſtinct acts and office. (2) In all the duties of the Saints they have their proper and diſtinct works; as in hearing, it is God the Father whoſe the truths are that they hear,<note place="margin">Eph. 3.9.</note> 
                     <hi>they are a myſtery hid in God from ages and from generations.</hi> The book of his counſels are in the hand of him that ſits upon the Throne, who is the <hi>Word of God,</hi> that is, the Interpreter of the Fathers mind, as the word of a man is of the mind of a man, which I conceive is the proper meaning of that expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſo <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.17. <hi>The law came by Moſes, but grace and truth by Jeſus Chriſt</hi> merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly; for there is not a truth revealed but coſt the blood of Chriſt, and it is as the Lamb that was ſlain, by virtue of his Prieſthood, that he doth open the book, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. And ſo the Spirit is the <hi>Eye-ſalve</hi> that gives us an underſtanding to receive the truths that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and doth ingraft the word into the heart: ſo in prayer alſo,<note place="margin">Joh. 5.20.</note> the Father is prayed unto; and therefore Chriſt teaches us in our prayers to look up unto God, and to cry, <hi>Our Father;</hi> not but that Chriſt and the Spirit may be prayed to, for they are God, they are believed in, and therefore are to be prayed unto; but yet becauſe of the different of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the perſons in this work of prayer, therefore we are mainly directed to pray unto the Father; ſo that he hears prayers, and the Spirit indites them,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.26.</note> and the Son he offers them with his own odours, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3. (3) It will appear alſo in the ſealing of the Saints, which, I conceive, is not the working of grace, as ſome ſay, and ſo the alluſion is of a ſeal, <hi>modo naturali,</hi> and ſo the Spirit in working an impreſſion of the image of Chriſt upon the ſoul is ſaid to ſeal it, leaving the like impreſſion in the man; but it is after a man believes;<note place="margin">Eph. 1.13.</note> and I conceive, that <hi>ſealing</hi> is uſed in Scripture chiefly in a metaphorical ſenſe, to aſſure and to mark out a perſon, as it's ſaid <hi>Ezech.</hi> 9. <hi>They were ſealed,</hi> that is, ſet apart for it, and <hi>ſeal the ſtone,</hi> that is, to make it ſure, to ratifie and confirm it. Now there are the diſtinct ſeals of all the perſons unto the evidences of the Saints, they have all of them a diſtinct witneſs, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. <hi>The Father, the Word, and the Spirit, and they three agree in one,</hi> they do all of them teſtifie the ſame thing, but yet they do all of them give a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct witneſs in the hearts of the Saints; as they did witneſs unto Chriſt, the Father from Heaven, and the Son in his Baptiſm, and the Spirit deſcending as a Dove, ſo they do alſo unto the ſouls of the Saints: and therefore Sacraments are called Seals: not that they do work the righteouſneſs of faith in any man; (for they do not work grace, but ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and witneſs grace) but becauſe they do aſſure it unto the man that doth receive them, and for that cauſe are ſaid to be ſealing Ordinances.</p>
                  <p n="2">§. 2. Now theſe diſtinct acts of office they do perform, are grounded upon the diſtinct intereſt that the Saints have in them all: and I call theſe acts of <hi>Office</hi> upon a double ground. [1] Becauſe they are but for a time, during the preſent adminiſtration of the mediatory Kingdom, which ſhall have its period, and then the Father will draw ſouls to Chriſt no more, the Son will preſent ſacrifice to God no more,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.24.</note> the Spirit will no longer aſſiſt, call, purge, ſanctifie, ſeal; but all the graces of the Subjects of the Kingdom of
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:52030:174"/> Chriſt ſhall be perfected, and all Gods ends in the Covenant of grace attained; and then the offices that were undertaken but for the accompliſhment of theſe ends ſhall be laid down. [2] Becauſe there is a perſonal glory that doth redound unto each perſon by theſe offices: there be natural acts that do add to the eſſential glory, the glory of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but acts of <hi>Office</hi> being perſonal, they add unto the glory of the perſons that do perform them;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.17, 18.</note> God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, the Father hath the glory thereof; and the Son he hath taken the form of a ſervant, and paid the ſervice, and made a purchaſe, and he has the glory thereof, all Nations are given unto him, and the honour of it in the hearts of all the Saints: <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.23. <hi>That all men may honour the Son,</hi> &amp;c. And the Holy Ghoſt he works all in the hearts of the Saints, he begins the good work,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.6.</note> and he perfects it; for all the graces of the Saints are but fruits of the Spirit, and therefore he has a diſtinct glory alſo. The great end and intent of God in the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was not only to ſhew forth the Attributes of his Nature, and to glorifie them in a higher way than ever they were formerly under the firſt Covenant diſcovered, as we have formerly ſeen; but alſo to exalt the glory of all the perſons in the hearts of the Saints, that they might, with hearts raviſhed with the love, goodneſs, and the offices of them all, cry out, <hi>Glory be unto the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt,</hi> and pray unto them all, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>Grace be unto you, and peace from him which was, and is, and which is to come, and from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Spirits before the Throne, and from Jeſus the faithful and true witneſs, the firſt begotten of the dead, and the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, who has loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins by his own blood, and has made us Kings and Prieſts unto God, and the Father, to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever,</hi> &amp;c. They have each of them their peculiar glory of the diſtinct works that they themſelves have wrought, and all of it is grounded upon this diſtinct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt that the Lord doth promiſe to the Saints, <hi>that he will be their God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. When the Saints come to glory, their communion with all theſe glorious perſons ſhall be perfected, they ſhall not only have perfect ſanctification, but communion; and as their communion in this life is not with God only, but with all the perſons diſtinctly, having hearts affected with love, and ſenſible of the communion of them all, ſo it ſhall be much more in Heaven; for the communion here that we have ſhall be perfected. Now in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven we ſhall have not only the viſion of God, that is, of his Eſſence, but alſo of all the perſons, we ſhall ſee God in <hi>Trinity,</hi> as well as in <hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Now the grounds of it are theſe.</hi> 1. That our happineſs might appear to conſiſt in the viſion and fruition of them all, therefore they are all of them diſtinctly made over by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to us, we ſhall not only ſee God in his Unity, but in his Trinity alſo, not only the glory of the Divine Eſſence, but the excellency of each of the perſons. This is a myſtery now that is inconceivable unto us, which we are not to pry into, which the Angel in a viſion told <hi>Auſtin</hi> while he was ſtudying and did endeavour to comprehend, he did but attempt to empty the Sea with a ſpoon into a pit, <hi>Scrutator Majeſtatis opprimitur à gloria.</hi> This Myſtery is here diſcovered only to the faith of the Saints; but that revelation which is in this life imperfect ſhall be perfected in Heaven, and our knowledge which in a way of faith is imperfect (for faith is a grace that doth ſuppoſe imperfection) that ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in viſion; for in Heaven whatever doth ſuppoſe ſin, or implies imperfection, ſhall be done away; therefore the Father as diſtinguiſhed from the Son, and the Son from the Father, the nature of the generation of the Son, and the proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, which now we have only revealed unto us that it is ſo, the nature and the manner of it we ſhall underſtand, ſo far as the creature is capable of ſuch glorious and inconceivable myſteries, and then in them all ſhall our happineſs conſiſt, and our ſoul is to have its por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the ſoul may honour them diſtinctly; for the aim of God in the new Covenant is not barely the glory of the Divine Eſſence, and to exalt in the hearts of the Saints the Attributes of the Nature, but the excellency of the perſons alſo; that they may honour the Son,<note place="margin">Joh. 5.23.</note> as they honour the Father, that they may give glory to the Father, Son, and holy Spirit, and may cry always day and night, <hi>Holy, holy, holy,</hi> Rev. 4.8. <hi>repetitâ acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione unum Jehovam celebrant, quem etiam trinum agnoſcunt, Bright.</hi> And the Lord doth in Scripture exceedingly ſtand upon a diſtinct glory, and to that very end requires not only a general and confuſed, but a diſtinct acknowledgment; not only that we ſhould know God to have all goodneſs and all ſufficiency in him, but the particular attributes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies that are in God; and not only to know Chriſt, to have all fulneſs in him, but
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:52030:174"/> that the ſoul ſee the ſeveral offices and the particular excellencies that are laid up in Chriſt, as the Church doth, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. for as elſe a man can never give God glory till his particular excellencies be known and diſcovered, ſo a man will never be in his own ſoul affected with it (for they are particulars that do affect:) as whilſt the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> heard but a general report of the wiſdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſhe was ſo far affected, as that ſhe was moved to come a great journey, even from the fartheſt parts of the Earth to hear his wiſdom; but when ſhe ſaw his wiſdom in the particulars of it, when he had anſwered all her queſtions, and ſhe had ſeen all his glory, there was no more ſpirit left in her,<note place="margin">1 King. 10.5.</note> they were the particulars that did affect, his wiſdom, and his houſe, and his ſervants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As it's in confeſſion, they are not generals that do affect, it's a ſmall thing for men to ſay, <hi>That they are all ſinners,</hi> and they have broken all the commands; but when a man ſees his ſins in the particulars <hi>ſet down in order before him,</hi> then is his ſoul amazed, and he doth abhor himſelf, never till then: and ſo it is in thankſgiving alſo. Now becauſe that all the perſons ſhall be glorified, and they ſhall all have great glory, therefore it muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct; and that it may come from a heart truly affected with it alſo, therefore he muſt give unto each perſon his diſtinct glory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That a man in this life may exerciſe diſtinct acts of faith upon them all, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1. <hi>You believe in God, believe alſo in me,</hi> not only to the glory of God the Father, but of the Son and Spirit alſo; that faith may have an eye <hi>unto God the Father of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14. and unto Chriſt as the Son, in whom he is well pleaſed, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.3. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is in the boſom of the Father able to reveal all his Fathers counſels unto the Saints, and interceding as he is the Son, and therefore is very powerful with him,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.16.</note> he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny the cry of a Son, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. <hi>ult.</hi> Though Chriſt as he is God cannot pray, becauſe he can ſtand in need of nothing that he ſhould go out of himſelf for, for he is God all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.11. Rev. 4.</note> yet it is the Godhead that gives an efficacy to all that is done in the humane nature. There are two things Chriſt does as he is a Prieſt. (1) His <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and the ſufficiency thereof is put upon the Godhead in the Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. <hi>The blood of God,</hi> and, <hi>We are made the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>He offered himſelf by the eternal Spirit without ſpot to God.</hi> (2) His <hi>Interceſſion:</hi> and though he doth intercede by the power of his ſatisfaction (for he doth enter within the moſt holy place) and doth ſprinkle the blood with the incenſe, his blood is a ſpeaking blood; yet the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of his Interceſſion is commonly put upon the ſtrength of the relation between God and him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7, 8. <hi>Thou art my Son,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ask of me and I will give thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou art Chriſt the Son of God,</hi> it's the confeſſion of <hi>Peters</hi> faith, and is alſo called the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Churches faith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. And ſo there is Divine Worſhip given to Chriſt as Mediator, <hi>they worſhip the Lamb,</hi> this is by reaſon of union; and yet it is evident,<note place="margin">Rev. 4.</note> that the humane nature remains a creature after its union, and therefore it is as he is the Son, and ſo is coeſſential with the Father, this is the <hi>formalis ratio,</hi> the proper cauſe of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith and Worſhip; and ſo the Holy Ghoſt alſo he is to be believed for himſelf and his own teſtimony: the Spirit is truth,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.6.</note> and the Scriptures are to be believed only for the teſtimony of the Spirit, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>But holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> therefore we are commanded to hear what the Spirit ſays unto the Churches; he is called therefore the <hi>Spirit of faith,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.13.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That we may honour them in our prayers diſtinctly: for whomſoever a man is to believe in, him he may pray unto, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>How can they call on him in whom they have not believed?</hi> And therefore in our prayers we are not only to go unto God, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to each of the perſons, with diſtinct petitions, ſuitable unto the acts that they have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, and the offices in which they have made over themſelves unto the Saints under the new Covenant. Chriſt he prays to the Father, <hi>Holy Father, righteous Father, I will that thoſe that thou haſt given me be with me, ſanctifie them by thy truth.</hi> And <hi>Stephen</hi> at his death, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit.</hi> And the Diſciples, <hi>Lord increaſe our faith.</hi> And ſo doth the Church, <hi>Tell me where thou feedeſt,</hi> &amp;c. The Apoſtle commonly ſpeaks of them all together, <hi>The grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God the Father, and the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the Spirit be with you.</hi> And <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>Grace from him that is, and was, and is to come, and from the ſeven Spirits that are before the Throne, and from Jeſus the faithful and true witneſs.</hi> And as it is a mans duty to believe in the Son as well as the Father, ſo it is to pray to the Son diſtinctly, as alſo unto the Father: for as our faith muſt diſtinctly take in all the objects of faith, or elſe it is imperfect; (for there are two things that tend to the perfection of any grace: (1) When it takes in all the objects in their extent and latitude. (2) When they do put forth compleat and perfect acts upon theſe objects: thus I ſay, as faith muſt take in all its objects, or elſe there is ſomething wanting in it, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:52030:175"/> of theſe their due and proper glory; and Chriſt being to be believed in, he may be prayed unto, nay it's an honour that belongs unto him, and therefore our faith muſt give it to him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That the ſoul may have a diſtinct fellowſhip and communion with them all; and there is a fellowſhip with the Spirit;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.3.</note> we are by the Goſpel brought into communion with God, and it's a diſtinct fellowſhip and communion that we are to have with all the perſons, our communion is as large as our relation, and the ſoul is to look upon himſelf as reconciled to them all; and therefore all of them are become our friends; and we have a particular and diſtinct intereſt in them all. Now how is a man ſaid to have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with God, or to walk with God? it is when the thoughts of a mans heart are taken up with God, and he has an eye unto him, and unto his glory from day to day: As a man is ſaid to have communion with the Devil, when he walks with his temptations, and the deſires and thoughts of his heart do run out towards the <hi>unfruitful works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> a man has fellowſhip with the Devil in all things, as it is ſaid; <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.22. <hi>The law ſhall talk with a man waking, and keep him when he is aſleep, and lead him when he goes;</hi> how is this is? it is but in the thoughts and the meditations of a mans own heart, by the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions and directions thereof, where it doth richly dwell; ſo it is in this alſo, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, and Gods dwelling in the ſoul, <hi>animus aſcendit frequenter, &amp;c. the ſoul frequently aſcends,</hi> there is <hi>gratiarum decurſus &amp; recurſus, a flowing down and reflowing of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and in this doth our communion lye. Now a man having an intereſt in all the perſons, all of them having undertaken ſomething for a mans good by way of office, and a man receiving ſomething from them all, and returning praiſe to them all, there is in the ſoul a diſtinct fellowſhip to be exerciſed with them all; ſometimes the thoughts of his heart being drawn out to the Father, and ſometimes unto the Son, and ſometimes unto the Spirit; and obſerving the witneſſing of them all, and the ſealing of them all unto the evidences of the Saints, ſometimes we walk with the Father, and ſometimes with the Son, and ſometimes with the Spirit; and the more diſtinct a mans communion is, the more ſweet it is.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That a man may draw arguments and motives unto duty and againſt ſin from them all, and a mans intereſt in them all. We are ſaid to be baptized in the name of them all,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.20.</note> 
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Now what is it to be baptized into the name of the Father? it's conceived to be taken from the manner of marriage, wherein the wife doth <hi>tranſire in nomen, in familiam, &amp;c. into the name and family of the husband:</hi> or of ſervants, who had their maſters name called upon them;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.13.</note> and therefore no man might be baptized in the name of a creature, it is that which <hi>Paul</hi> deteſts, that he ſhould baptize in his own name; and therefore the meaning is, to be baptized <hi>in fidem, in cultum, into the faith and worſhip of God;</hi> and ſo you are unto them all, and give up your names unto them all; and therefore unto each per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we owe both faith and worſhip diſtinctly, all manner of duty and obedience, becauſe we are diſtinctly baptized unto the faith of them all, to believe in them, and worſhip them: and a man ſhould draw arguments to keep him from ſin from them all, and his intereſt in them all, the Father is greater than all, and it is by his will we are ſanctified: <hi>If we call him Father, who without reſpect of perſons judgeth every man according to his works. Paſs the time of your ſojourning here in fear,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.15. And he ſays of Chriſt, <hi>I ſend my Angel, but take heed of him, obey his voice, provoke him not, for my name is in him. And grieve not the holy Spirit, by whom you are ſealed to the day of redemption,</hi> do not reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, do not tempt him, leſt he forſake you, and ſay, <hi>I will ſtrive with you no more.</hi> A man ſhould fear the evil aſpect of any word of God, and the eſtrangement of any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, that he ſhould be in ſuch a condition, that he cannot go to it with boldneſs and comfort, and be kept off from an Ordinance of God, that he cannot eat the Paſsover with the people of God in the ſeaſon of it: how much more when a man ſhall look up upon the Father, Son, and Spirit, and ſees any of theſe eſtranged from him; for they ſeek the glory one of another, and delight to have each other honoured in the hearts of the Saints; and if thou walk unworthily towards any of them, they are all of them provoked and diſpleaſed thereby.</p>
                  <p n="3">§. 3. Let us now take a view of the particulars, how, and in what reſpect each perſon doth make over himſelf unto the Saints in the ſecond Covenant, that we may ſee how they have an intereſt in them all. 1. God the Father makes over himſelf in Covenant unto the Saints as he is the Father;<note place="margin">Joh. 20.</note> therefore Chriſt calls him <hi>My Father and your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, my God and your God.</hi> The Saints alſo call him our Father, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.1. <hi>In God our Father,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt is his Son by nature, as he is God, and as Mediator, he is taken into the ſame Sonſhip by the grace of <hi>perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> Luke 1.35. <hi>That holy thing which ſhall

Now what is it to have an intereſt in him as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that we can call him <hi>Abba Father?</hi> The ſweetneſs of that relation is very great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Saints; for he is <hi>the Father of mercies,</hi> and he is <hi>the Father of lights,</hi>

                  <p>This being premiſed, let us now ſee how each perſon has made over himſelf unto Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in reference unto the ſecond Covenant. (1) As a diſtinct object of their faith; for there are diſtinct acts of faith to be exerciſed upon all theſe perſons anſwerable unto their appropriated acts:<note place="margin">Joh. 14.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Ye believe in God,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>believe alſo in me;</hi> for though the ultimate object of faith be God (for by Chriſt the Mediator we believe in God) yet the ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are to have faith diſtinctly exerciſed upon them,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.21.</note> anſwerable unto that diſtinct reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of themſelves.<note place="margin">Joh. 5.23. Rev. 1.4.</note> (2) As a diſtinct object of worſhip, <hi>That every man might honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. Grace and peace from him that is, and was, and is to come, and from the ſeven Spirits that are before the Throne.</hi> (3) As diſtinct grounds of their conſolation; for though God be the God of all conſolation, yet there is a diſtinct conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation comes from each perſon, anſwerable unto their appropriated acts, which is the ground of a diſtinct communion. (4) For their ſalvation, each of the perſons having their proper work in bringing many ſons to glory; but it has been ſhewed, that theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated acts, which I called Acts of Office, are but for a time taken up with reference unto the mediatory Kingdom, and when that ſhall be ended, and all the Saints perfected
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:52030:176"/> and glorified, and the Kingdom again given up into the hand of the Father, then <hi>God ſhall be all in all;</hi> and the perſons ſhall act joyntly without any ſuch appropriation for ever: and look what the Spirit in the Word has ſpoken of each perſon, that we may be aſſured of, that each perſon has undertaken; for the Spirit of God knows the mind of God and the things of God, and the Lord would never have ſpoken ſo of himſelf, but that he would have us to look upon them as acts that the perſons had each of them undertaken for the Elect, and theſe we way build upon in the new Covenant, that they have and will perform.</p>

                  <p n="1">§. 1. GOD the Father has ſpoken of himſelf diſtinctly, and has taken upon himſelf ſome appropriated acts, and hath in them made over himſelf unto the Saints for their conſolation and ſalvation, which we ſhall demonſtrate unto you in theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. 1. All things begin at God the Father, he is firſt in order of working, as he is in the order of ſubſiſting; he was the firſt Plotter and Mover in this great work of mans ſalvation; for the Son ſaith, <hi>He can do nothing of himſelf in it,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 5.19.</note> 
                     <hi>but what he ſees the Father do;</hi> and therefore <hi>Luke</hi> 24.9. Chriſt calls it <hi>his Fathers buſineſs:</hi> as though <hi>Solomon</hi> built the Temple, yet the Platform was revealed unto <hi>David,</hi> and by him was left unto his ſon; ſo though Chriſt, this <hi>Solomon</hi> was to build the Temple, the man whoſe name is the Branch, yet the Platform of all was laid by the Father; and therefore he is in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture every where ſaid to have the firſt and the great hand therein: and I ſhall reduce theſe to two heads. (1) The Actions that are undertaken by the Father. (2) The Relations in which the Saints ſtand unto the Father.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Actions, that according unto Scripture-acceptation the Father has undertaken, and theſe are of two ſorts. (1) There are ſome acts that are eternal and before time. (2) There are ſome that are done by the Father in time. 1. The actions of the Father before all time, and they are theſe. (1) He did from Eternity purpoſe to glorifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Son; for the Father will be glorified in the Son, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.11. The great end of all the acts of Chriſt, and of all his life is this, that every tongue might confeſs,<note place="margin">Joh. 14.13.</note> 
                     <hi>That Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is the Lord, unto the glory of God the Father;</hi> for this is the higheſt way of glorifying the Father, and therefore Chriſt knowing that to be the Fathers end, that he might ſhew himſelf to be the Fathers ſervant, he did aim at this end, and it was always in his eye in all things that he did, <hi>I ſeek not mine own glory, but the glory of him that ſent me, Joh.</hi> 8.50. There is one that ſeeks not his own glory, and therefore <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2, 3. he is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is <hi>the ſhining forth of the glory of the Father;</hi> for his great aim was from Eternity to be glorified in his Son; and therefore 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.7. Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>the image and glory of God,</hi> and <hi>the woman the mans glory,</hi> the <hi>head of Chriſt is God.</hi> Now glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is the manifeſtation and the ſhining forth of ſome ſupereminent and tranſcendent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency. And it was an argument of great excellency that was in man, that all the creatures were created for man, and put in ſubjection unto him; but the higheſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of man was the woman, who was created in the ſame nature, having a reaſonable ſoul, as himſelf had; and ſouls know no ſexes, being created after the ſame image, and unto the ſame glory with himſelf, and yet this glorious creature ſhould be created for man, and put in ſubjection unto man, for the woman was created for the man: ſo alſo God hath great glory by all his creatures, for <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4. <hi>He made all things for himſelf;</hi> and he has a more ſpecial honour from the reaſonable creatures, the Angels and the Saints; but yet the top and the higheſt of God the Fathers glory is, that the Son, who thought it no robbery to be equal with God in glory, yet ſhall give up himſelf to the glory of the Father; and this is a far greater glory than the Father has by all the creatures in Heaven and Earth. And there is a double glory that the Father did ſeek by the Son: (1) That the Son himſelf ſhould give him glory, ſhould ſeek his glory in all things, reflect all his own glory upon the Father, and attribute all to him, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to veil his own glory, that the glory of the Father might appear. (2) He has the glory of all that glory that is given to the Son by the Saints, it's all ultimately reſolved into his glory who is the Father, as all the promiſes of God in Chriſt are <hi>in him Yea,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.29.</note> 
                     <hi>and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us, Phil.</hi> 2.11. All the confeſſions and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments that are made unto Chriſt, do all of them redound unto the praiſe and glory of
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:52030:177"/> God; for the more the Son is glorified, the more it redounds unto the glory of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe glory the Son ſeeks in all that he does; and therefore in every reſpect the Father is glorified in the Son: and this was the great plot that God made from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. (2) The Fathers purpoſe was to glorifie the Son in the Saints, that he might make him the head of both the Creations of God. [1] To them that ſtood; ſo he is the head of all Principalities and Powers, that they ſhould all hold of him; and ſo they ſhould all honour the Son as they honour the Father;<note place="margin">Col. 2.10.</note> and therefore it's ſaid <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. the Angels do worſhip him; and ſo Angels are round about the Throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.11. The Father will receive glory from no creature, but it ſhall be by the Son; for the great glory of the Father we muſt ſtill remember comes in by him, and all the honour that they do unto the Son redounds unto God the Father. [2] As for them that ſhould fall, as well as thoſe that ſtood:<note place="margin">Joh. 5.23. Joh. 17.10.</note> 
                     <hi>All men muſt honour the Son, even as they honour the Father,</hi> and he that honours not the Son, honours not the Father; and therefore Chriſt ſays, <hi>All thine are mine, and mine are thine, I am glorified in them;</hi> ſo that all the glory that the Son had, its foundation was laid in the plot and purpoſe of the Father. I ſpeak of his <hi>manifeſtative glory;</hi> as for his eſſential glory, he had that from himſelf, as he is God of himſelf, and was therein equal with God; and did no more receive his glory from another, than he did his eſſence from another; but having one and the ſame eſſence, they muſt needs have one and the ſame glory; but as for the glory that he hath amongſt the creatures and from them all, it's from and by the plot of God the Father: to this end was Chriſt the head of both Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.<note place="margin">Eſay 42.1. Eph. 1.4.</note> (3) The purpoſe of the Father was to glorifie the Elect, which he choſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of both Creations; and therefore 'tis ſaid <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>He has choſen us in him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundations of the world were laid.</hi> He choſe him as the head, and the Elect as the body:<note place="margin">Eph. 1.9, 10.</note> 
                     <hi>He has made known unto us the good pleaſure of his will, according as he purpoſed in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to gather together all things unto one, whether things in heaven, or things on earth.</hi> There is a Myſtery in the Goſpel which is called the hidden Wiſdom, which God hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the world unto our glory; it was free grace to mind the glory of the Elect next to the glory of his own Son,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.7.</note> and that as the Son ſhall glorifie him, ſo alſo the glory of the Son ſhall come in by the glory of the Saints; and the Son ingaged, who was the Lord of glory, <hi>to bring many ſons to glory</hi> by this, becauſe therein ſhould his own glory conſiſt; for at the day of Judgment the great glory of Chriſt ſhall be in his Saints, <hi>He ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints, and be admired in them that believe,</hi> &amp;c. And if he did look upon man as fallen, he need never have taken up ſuch a purpoſe as this is; for being enemies, he had a priſon that was large enough to have held them all,<note place="margin">Eſay 10. <hi>ult.</hi>

But now the Son being God equal with the Father, it was every way free with him to have conſented unto the terms of this Covenant, or not; but he did it freely, <hi>Lo I come to do thy will, O God.</hi> (6) In this Covenant he did appoint unto his Son what glory he ſhould have, and what glory and grace the Saints ſhould have: <hi>He hath given us eternal life,</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. There are ſome acts that take place in time, though the decree and purpoſe of them was from everlaſting; and theſe acts of the Father either concern Chriſt or the Saints, they are acts that are more immediately terminated in him, or in us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Acts of the Father which do more immediately concern Chriſt are theſe. 1. When the fulneſs of time appointed by the Father was come, then he ſent him into the world, and that which was before only in Decree and Covenant, he doth now put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>When the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent his Son made of a woman,</hi> &amp;c. So that the ſending Chriſt into the world was God the Fathers act:<note place="margin">Luther.</note> 
                     <hi>mos Scripturae eſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus exactum ac finitum impletum dicere,</hi> the Decree of his coming into the world was from everlaſting, and the Son did ingage himſelf unto it by Covenant from everlaſting; but yet there was a ſet time appointed by the Father when this ſhould actually be put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and when that time was come, and fully accompliſhed, then God the Father did put this great plot in execution; and therefore when Chriſt came into the world he is ſaid to come out from the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.28. <hi>I came forth from the Father, and came into the world.</hi> And again, <hi>I leave the world, and go to the Father.</hi> So that the Son's taking our fleſh is done in obedience to the Father, and he is ſaid to be ſent unto that end: the Father did not only ſend him in reference to the office that he did undertake being made fleſh, but he did alſo ſend him to take fleſh, <hi>Non ideo miſſus Filius, quia Verbum caro factum eſt, ſed ideo miſſus, ut Verbum caro fieret, The Son was not therefore ſent, becauſe the Word took
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:52030:178"/> fleſh, but therefore ſent, that the Word might take fleſh, Auſtin.</hi> Why did not Chriſt come ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner into the world, but in the laſt days? The reaſon in reſpect of Chriſt was, becauſe the time was not come that was determined by the Father, and he was as well obedient in the time of his coming, as in the coming it ſelf, his obedience was ſeaſonable, it was in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time. But why did not God the Father ſend his Son ſooner into the world? As it is not for us to know the times and the ſeaſons, ſo it is not for us to inquire into the reaſon of them. <hi>Bernard</hi> gives this reaſon, <hi>Cùm magis eſſet neceſſarium, tunc primò ferret auxilium:</hi> all ways had been uſed, and all means tryed, and all in vain, and now <hi>non ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parebat Angelus, non loquebatur Propheta, &amp;c.</hi> The Scepter was departed, Prophecy ceaſed, and all ways of intercourſe and converſe between God and man ſeemed to be at an end, now is the ſeaſon to recover loſt man; now therefore the Father did appoint him to come into the world, and he ſaith, <hi>Lo I come to do thy will, O God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2.

Here I meet with a deep ſilence amongſt all Interpreters, only I find this to be offered by <hi>Kemnitius,</hi> 
                     <q>That the grace that we receive is laid up in Chriſt by God the Father, and in the Goſpel Chriſt is but God the Fathers Servant; and therefore though grace be given unto us by Chriſt, yet it is by the appointment of the Father, and Chriſt is only the Fathers Servant in it, and ſo the principal efficient of faith is God the Father, though you do receive it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from Chriſt.</q> This is true, that all the grace that we receive from Chriſt all our days here, and all the glory we ſhall have to Eternity, was by the Father laid up for us in Chriſt, and in the whole work Chriſt is but the Fathers Servant; but why in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner is this work of the Father appropriated unto the work of converſion and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? The ground of it I conceive to be this: In the Covenant that paſſed between Chriſt and the Father, the Lord did require this ſervice of him, that he ſhould lay down his life, and give himſelf for the Elect, he gave himſelf a ranſom for many, and he did make him a promiſe, that he would give thoſe ſouls unto him again. Therefore as in the fulneſs of time the Lord did give Chriſt for them, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto us a Child is born,</hi>

                     <hi>unto us a Son is given,</hi> and ſo he is called by way of eminency <hi>the gift of God;</hi> for though he were promiſed from the beginning of the world, yet he was not actually given and exhibited till the laſt days; ſo there is a time alſo when God the Father muſt fulfil this promiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, to give ſouls unto him, as he has given himſelf for them, in obedience to the Father. Now when are ſouls given unto Chriſt? It is when they come to him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, they are not actually any part of his charge till then; and therefore they are ſaid to be without Chriſt, they have no actual relation to Chriſt, or Chriſt to them,<note place="margin">Joh. 4.10.</note> for the union between Chriſt and the ſoul is matrimonial, and it is the Father that gives them each unto other; and therefore marriage between <hi>Adam</hi> and his wife is made a type and reſemblance of it, or rather myſtery, called by the Jews <hi>Cabala, Eph.</hi> 5.33. <hi>This is a great myſtery, but I ſpeak of Chriſt and the Church:</hi> ſo that it's God the Father that gives Chriſt to the ſoul, and gives the ſoul unto Chriſt, he it is that doth joyn them in a marriage-covenant for ever. Therefore as when the time appointed by the Father was come, he ſent his Son actually into the world; ſo when the time of love is come, that a ſoul ſhould be converted, who before lay polluted in his blood, then doth God the Father ſend his Spirit in Chriſts name into the ſoul, who doth diſcover the beauty of Chriſt and the free grace of God the Father, how ready and willing he is to beſtow him; and the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of this grace of the Father is made effectual to the ſoul, not only to perſwade, but alſo to enable it to accept of Chriſt upon the terms that he is offered. And upon this ground the work of vocation is mainly attributed unto the <hi>drawing</hi> and <hi>the teaching of the Father;</hi> becauſe as they were in the purpoſe of God, and in the Covenant between Chriſt and the Father given to him from all Eternity, ſo they are by the Father actually given to him in the fulneſs of time, that is, when the time of their converſion appointed by the Father is come; and therefore the inlightning of the ſoul in this work is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the Father, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>God that commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts,</hi> &amp;c. and by the ſame almighty Word that he did that work in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he doth ſhine into our hearts, diſcovering Chriſt unto us and the glory of God; all the incommunicable Attributes of God are gloriouſly ſet forth in the Man Chriſt Jeſus, and ſo the power by which the ſoul is enabled to believe, is the power of God the Father, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17, 19. <hi>That the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of glory, would ſhew you what is the exceeding greatneſs of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of the mighty power which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead:</hi> ſo that if any ſoul be brought home unto Chriſt in a work of vocation, it is by the almighty working of God the Father, and you are to acknowledge his grace, as well in giving you unto Chriſt, as in giving Chriſt unto you.</p>

                  <p n="2">§. 2. The ſecond relation of the Father unto Chriſt is, that he is Chriſts <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.3. <hi>The head of Chriſt is God, the head of every man is Chriſt,</hi>

                  <p n="1">(1) He doth give unto Chriſt a Law, as he is his Lord and King; for God the Father is the great Law-giver, Chriſt doth nothing but as the Fathers ſubject, and in obedience unto him; ſo <hi>Eſay</hi> 42.1. he is called but <hi>the Fathers ſervant,</hi> and he does only the Fathers buſineſs, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.49. and he receives a Law from him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. <hi>This commandment have I received of my Father; this law is in the middle of my bowels,</hi> and it was a law commanding him to lay down his life for his people; and ſo do the Saints, for Chriſt is God the Fathers King, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.1.

As Chriſt is the true Vine, ſo the Father is the Husbandman: Chriſt is not here ſpoken of as a head in heaven, for ſo he has no dead members; but it's ſpoken of him as ſpreading himſelf into a viſible Church, which is ſometimes compared unto a <hi>Vine, Jer.</hi> 2.21. and ſometimes to an <hi>Olive-tree, Rom.</hi> 11. and of this Vine the Father is the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman or the Vine-dreſſer: for there are branches in this Vine that do bear no fruit, <hi>parentes pampinarii.</hi> Now there is a double act of the Father in this relation.

                     <hi>For who is he that plants a vineyard, and doth not drink thereof, he lets it out unto vine-dreſſers,</hi> &amp;c. and it was to yield for the fruit of it a thouſand pieces of ſilver; there is nothing more hateful than an <hi>empty Vine; Hoſ.</hi> 10.1. and theſe branches he takes away, and they are caſt out. [1] They are caſt out of the hearts of Gods people, and out of their prayers, and in the end they are caſt out of their ſociety. [2] They wither: their gifts wither, and their former ſeeming graces from which they had their greenneſs decay, their lamps go out. [3] Men gather them, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks gather them, or profane men gather them, for they ſhall be gathered together in bundles, thoſe of their own kind, and all thoſe ſpiritual judgments that compleat a man for ſeparation from God, befal ſuch a man, and this puniſhment is from God the Father, who is the Husbandman. (2) All the branches that are fruitful he doth purge them, that they may bring forth more fruit. There are two parts of Sanctification, and there is a growth of a Chriſtian ſeen in them both; there is a growth in grace, the new image is more viſibly ſeen; and there is a growth in mortification, or the decay of the old image: the new man is renewed day by day, and the old man decays day by day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In viſible Churches the purging of the members is the Fathers act, the remainders of ſin are the great miſery of a Saint. Now to whom ſhould a man look to be cleanſed? It's true, that it's the ſprinkling of the blood of Chriſt upon the conſcience by which it is done; but it is properly the act of God the Father applying this blood; for every degree of grace in the one or the other, it's an act of the grace of the Father. But more particularly, here are three things to be ſpoken to for the opening of this relation, that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the fruit, and taſte the ſweetneſs thereof.

Again, a Palm the more weight it has hung upon it, the more it grows, and the deeper it takes root, as the Walnut-tree, the more it's beaten, the more it bears. (3) It's compared to a <hi>Cedar, Pſal.</hi> 92.12. and <hi>Ezech.</hi> 17.23. <hi>He ſhall grow as a cedar in Lebanon.</hi> [1] For its deep root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for it's the ſtrongeſt of all the trees: as the wood of it is of all other leaſt ſubject unto putrefaction; ſo in reſpect of the deep rooting of it it's of all other trees leaſt ſubject unto ſubverſion; ſo the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God is ſaid to be, <hi>He ſhall caſt forth his roots as Lebanon,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Auſtin.</note> but it's ſpoken of Chriſt ſpreading himſelf into a viſible Church here upon earth, and his being the root notes two things: (1) Their union with him, as the branches have with the root; and therefore they are ſaid to be in him, even thoſe that bear no fruit: ſome are in him only by <hi>profeſſion,</hi> and ſome by a real <hi>coalition.</hi> (2) They may ſuck ſap from him, for the fooliſh Virgins have the oyl in their lamps from him, as well as the wiſe that have oyl in their veſſels; the one have the oyl of gifts, from whence their greenneſs comes, though they afterward wither, and the other have the oyl of their graces; the one has it from the Spirit of Chriſt aſſiſting, and the other from the ſame Spirit inhabiting or infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; for there are two ſorts of branches in this Vine, as the Text makes manifeſt.</p>

                  <p n="2">(2) The Father as Husbandman fenceth the Vine: he that plants the Vine, he it is alſo that makes the fence; for the inviſible Church of God has ſpiritual enemies, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things; but the viſible Church, that has variety of outward enemies; as <hi>the lily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst thorns:</hi> ſometimes the Foxes by their ſubtilty ſeek to ſpoil the vines, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the wild Boar out of the wood doth endeavour to root it up, and yet it is preſerved, the buſh is in the fire, and yet it's not conſumed, it is becauſe there is a hedge about it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.29. ſays Chriſt, <hi>My Father that gave them me is greater than all, and no man can pluck them out of my Fathers hand:</hi> Job 1.10. <hi>Thou haſt made a hedge about him, and all that he has round about;</hi> and this hedge of protection is ſometimes made by Gods own imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate hand, <hi>Zac.</hi> 2.5.

Now when the Lord doth pluck up the hedge, and break down the wall of the viſible Church, we then ſee what terrible inroads all the enemies do make, and how they come in and ſpoil her; <hi>The Boar of the wood doth waſte it, and the beaſts of the field devour it, Pſal.</hi> 80.13. ſo that it's God the Father only that makes the hedge, and he it is that doth remove the fence, and he it is that has the hand in making it up again.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) He as the Husbandman doth hire labourers into his Vineyard; for it is the work of God the Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.1. as he is the Lord of the harveſt, ſo he doth thruſt forth labourers into his harveſt; as he is the husbandman, ſo he doth hire labourers into his vineyard, which is the viſible Church, and the labourers are the officers and the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that do labour therein, and they are ſaid to be hired, (1) <hi>ratione pacti,</hi> becauſe there doth as it were a bargain and an agreement paſs between God and them; for anſwerable unto a mans end, ſuch is the implicite agreement that he makes with God; and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable unto that, ſo God will give a man a reward: if a man do it for profit, he ſhall have it; but then he is ſaid not to ſerve Chriſt, but his own belly; and if he do it for praiſe of men, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>They have their reward,</hi> &amp;c.

It may be ſome do wonder that the Lord lets wicked men alone to continue in the Church ſo long, why they are not immediately caſt out; truly if the Father be the Husbandman, let us leave it to his pruning, for it's his work, and he will do it, in his time and ſeaſon, we muſt not undertake to direct him which ſeaſon is beſt, he keeps it in his own power, and he doth it at the fitteſt time; ſo that after this pruning the other branches may grow better, and the Father hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken it; and though there may be ſome hypocrites that may a long time eſcape the eyes of men, and the cenſure of the Church, yet they ſhall not eſcape the Fathers eye, who is the Husbandman. There is a ſpiritual Excommunication that goes forth againſt them from him, and he will ſurely caſt them out as dead branches, and he hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a fire for them, and they are burnt; and there is no man that burns ſo fiercely in Hell as ſuch dry wood prepared for the fire; for all the <hi>veſſels of wrath are fitted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> as well as the veſſels of mercy are prepared for glory.</p>

Sometimes by the inward motions of the Spirit, diſcovering the filthineſs of ſin, and ſtirring up a mans heart to hate it, and himſelf for it, that a man ſhall make it his buſineſs to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie ſin; and as Chriſt ſuffered in the fleſh, and ceaſed from ſin, ſo he doth arm him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the ſame mind, his reſolution is the armor that ſtrengthens and eſtabliſhes his heart therein. 3. Many times the Lord doth it by ſhedding abroad his love in the ſoul, ſo that the ſenſe thereof makes a man to purifie himſelf from all filthineſs both of fleſh and ſpirit, as the exhortation alſo is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Having this hope</hi> [ſuch exceeding great and precious promiſes] <hi>let us perfect holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> [2] The reviving of the new man; it's the Fathers end that they may bring forth more fruit, for they are ordained to bear fruit, a vine is of no worth, if it be not fruitful; therefore <hi>Col.</hi> 2.19. they are ſaid <hi>to increaſe with the increaſe of God</hi> 1.

                  <p n="5">§. 5. We come now unto the laſt particular of the perſonal and appropriated relation of God the Father as he ſtands unto Chriſt, and in him unto us: as he is his Father and our Father, our God and his God, his friend, ſo he is the fountain of the life of Chriſt, and in him the fountain of ſpiritual life to us alſo,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.11.</note> and that is ſet down, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.11. <hi>God hath given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son:</hi> we ſee of what perſon it's ſpoken, it is the Father that hath given us this life, and laid it up in his Son, as in a common Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.57.</note> that from him it might be conveyed unto us. So <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.57. <hi>As the living Father hath ſent me, and I live by the Father; ſo he that eateth me, even he ſhall live by me.</hi> Here in the opening of it I muſt ſhew, (1) <hi>Whether this be ſpoken of Chriſt as he is God, or as he is Mediator?</hi> (2) <hi>How Chriſt as Mediator is ſaid to live by the Father?</hi> (3) <hi>What the life is that we have from Chriſt?</hi> (4) <hi>That all this life that we have from Chriſt and is in him, is from the Father, he that is the fountain of the life of Chriſt, is alſo the fountain of our life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether it be ſpoken here of Chriſt as he is God, or as he is Mediator, God manifeſted in the fleſh?</hi> That it's not ſpoken of Chriſt as he is God, there are three things do clearly make it manifeſt. (1) It's ſpoken of Chriſt with reſpect unto his Office; for he ſpeaks of himſelf as ſent by the Father, and ſending is a term of office. Now as he is ſent by the Father, ſo he lives by the Father: but he is ſent as Mediator, and it wholly relates unto his Office in which he is by the Father imployed; and therefore it is as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator that he lives by the Father. (2) It's ſpoken of Chriſt as he is fed upon by the faithful, <hi>I live by the Father, ſo he that eats me ſhall live by me,</hi> which refers to him as he is made man; for ſo he ſaith <hi>verſ.</hi> 34. <hi>He that eats my fleſh and drinks my blood, hath eternal life,</hi> &amp;c. Now the Father is the fountain of life unto Chriſt in the ſame reſpect that Chriſt is the fountain of life unto us; but it is as Mediator that he is ſo to us, as he hath fleſh and blood, for ſo he becomes unto us a natural head; and therefore ſuited to be an object of our faith, fit both to be our ſurety here, and our Advocate in Heaven; our ſurety here, as having our nature, and therefore being able to pay our debt; and our Advocate hereafter, as having our nature ſtill upon him, and therefore knows how to have mercy and compaſſion, the ſame nature in him will incline him thereunto. (3) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that it were dangerous to ſay, that as he is God, ſo he lives by the Father, though I often find that Divines writing of the eternal generation of the Son, do ſpeak of the Fathers begetting of the Son by the communication of the ſame Eſſence, that <hi>he is God of God,</hi> &amp;c. But ſurely he that is God, muſt be without cauſe, he muſt have his Being from himſelf, he muſt be the firſt and the laſt; he that hath his eſſence from another muſt have his ſufficiency from another, and he that is from another muſt be unto another; for he that is the firſt cauſe, he muſt alſo be the laſt end, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. <hi>For of him, and to him, and through him are all things,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore he that is not God of himſelf, is not God at all.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>What is the life, which as Mediator Chriſt receives from the living Father?</hi> There are two words in Scripture unto which commonly all things excellent or deſirable are compared, and thoſe are <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life;</hi> and ſo all miſery is ſet forth under the two contraries, and they are <hi>Darkneſs</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.11. <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous: in thy light we ſhall ſee light,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <hi>thy loving-kindneſs is better than life;</hi> life is that which doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in it all good things, as the leſſer is comprehended of the greater; for <hi>the life is more worth than meat, and the body than raiment;</hi> and ſo it implies that Jeſus the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor doth receive all things that are good, excellent, and deſirable from God the Father, he doth live by the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he is unto him the fountain of all good things: But this is but general. I find life in Scripture uſed four ways, as ſtanding in oppoſition unto a four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold death in us. (1) There is a death in reference to the <hi>guilt</hi> of ſin, a man being under the ſentence of the Law dead; and in oppoſition thereunto there is <hi>a life of Righteouſneſs</hi> in Juſtification: therefore it's ſaid <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17, 18. <hi>For if by one mans offence death raigned by one, much more they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gifts of righteouſneſs ſhall raign in life by one Jeſus Chriſt: therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſo by the righteouſneſs of one the free gift came upon all men unto juſtification to life.</hi> (2) There is a death in reference to the <hi>dominion</hi> of ſin; and thus we are ſaid <hi>to be dead in treſpaſſes and ſins:</hi> and ſo there is a life of <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Regeneration,</hi> when the Lord

(3) There is a death in <hi>ſorrow,</hi> and under <hi>miſery,</hi> as the Jews were in their Captivity, they were dry bones dead, and their reſtoring of peace and comfort was a reſurrection from the dead, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 37.12. and ſo <hi>Heman</hi> is <hi>free amongst the dead,</hi> as they that are wounded and lye in the grave, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in oppoſition thereunto there is a <hi>life of conſolation,</hi>

HAving finiſhed the doctrinal part, and ſeen how God the Father makes over himſelf in the Covenant of Grace to the Saints; for their portion lyes in God, not only in the Attributes of the nature, but in an intereſt in the perſons alſo; and we have an intereſt in all the actions that the Father appropriated, whether they be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, or in time, and thoſe whether terminated in Chriſt immediately, or in us; and we have ſeen how we have an intereſt in all the perſonal relations of the Father, that in the ſame relations he ſtands to Chriſt, in the ſame he ſtands to us alſo; he is his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and our Father, his God and our God; he is our Father, our King, our Friend, our Husbandman, and the Fountain of our life, for he hath given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son: Now we come to apply all this to our ſelves, and it ſhall be 1. for <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> that ſo in ſo great a truth as this, we may not be miſtaken. And here we are to conſider, (1) that a man hath intereſt in all the perſons at once, they all be given to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; a man hath not firſt an intereſt in the Father, and then in the Son, and then in the Spirit, but having an intereſt in one, he hath an intereſt in them all, he that hath the Son hath the Father alſo, he hath the Father and the Son.<note place="margin">Joh. 2.23. Joh. 2.9.</note> And by this we may ſee what a glorious change there is in a man when he is converted and made one with Chriſt, he hath an intereſt in all the Attributes of God. It's true, that they do all act for him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſucceſſively, and according to a mans neceſſity at ſeveral times they work for his
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:52030:188"/> good; ſometimes an act of mercy is put forth for him, ſometimes an act of power, ſometimes wiſdom, ſometimes patience; but yet the ſoul comes to have an intereſt in them all at once, and at the ſame time, and when he is intitled to the one, he is intitled to the other, even to them all: and ſo it is with the Perſons alſo, the title Believers have to them begins at once. As a man hath intereſt in Chriſt the Mediator; it's true, that Chriſt doth exerciſe all his Offices for his ſpiritual good ſucceſſively, and he is now to him a Prieſt to offer his Sacrifice, and to bear his iniquity, now he is a Prophet to teach him, now he is a King to govern him; and there are diſtinct acts of all theſe offices; but yet the ſoul hath an intereſt in them all at once: As it is in all grace; it's true, that the graces of Gods Spirit do all of them act in their places;<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.5.</note> for we are to <hi>add to our faith vertue, and to our vertue knowledge,</hi> &amp;c. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="2">2. Though the intereſt of Gods people begin at once in all the perſons, yet the Lord would have us take notice, that there is a diſtinct intereſt in them all to be attained unto; for the more diſtinct our apprehenſions are, the more glory we give unto God, and the greater will our own comfort be: God delights not in generalities, neither in general confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, nor in general apprehenſions or thankſgivings. As it is in the Attributes of the Nature of God, though a ſoul that hath an intereſt in God in Covenant, hath a title to them all at once, yet they are all of them as ſo many diſtinct objects for faith to work and reſt upon; as mercy, and juſtice, and holineſs, and wiſdom, and faithfulneſs; and the ſoul ſhould not only be content with a general apprehenſion that he hath an intereſt in them all, but ſhould be diſtinctly drawn forth, and exerciſe diſtinct acts of faith upon them all: And as it is in Chriſt, there are diſtinct excellencies in him, there is the Holineſs of his Nature, the Holineſs of his Life, and the fulneſs of his Satisfaction, the glory of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and a ſoul that hath an intereſt in Chriſt, and is made one with him, hath immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately an intereſt in all theſe; but yet the Lord requires that the faith of his Saints ſhould be exerciſed about them all, and have their apprehenſion raiſed by the glory of them all: As a man that believes any one part of the Word of God, doth believe the whole Word of God at the ſame time; for faith that doth cloſe with any Divine Truth aright, doth it upon this ground, to reſt upon God, <hi>tam in revelatis, quàm revelandis, as well in what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, as what is to be revealed:</hi> as it was with <hi>Adam</hi> and the Angels, unto whom there are made daily new diſcoveries of the will and counſel of God, that they never knew before; but yet there is not a precept,<note place="margin">Eph. 3.10.</note> promiſe, or threatning in the whole Word of God, but it is a diſtinct object of faith, and the Lord would have the apprehenſions of his people particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſet upon them, that they may be particularly affected with them, and ſee and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the grace of God in giving them an intereſt in this promiſe, and in that threatning: So it is true, that a man that hath an intereſt in the Son of God, hath an intereſt alſo in God the Father, and ſo a man may conſider it <hi>diſcurſivè, diſcurſively;</hi> but the Lord would have the ſoul ſtay upon the particular intereſt he hath in the Father and the glory thereof, and upon the particular intereſt he hath in the Son and the glory thereof alſo. As it is in point of aſſurance, though he that hath the witneſs of the Father and the Son, hath the witneſs of the Spirit alſo; and he that is aſſured of the love of one, may be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the love of them all; yet there is a diſtinct bringing home of the love of each per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the ſoul; ſo that a man doth not by way of diſcourſe only reaſon himſelf into the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:52030:188"/> Father, Son, and Spirit, who having one nature have alſo one love, and if I have a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the love of the Son in me, I have alſo a witneſs thereby of the love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo; but when the ſoul is particularly drawn out and diſtinctly affected with the love of each of the perſons, his apprehenſions are raiſed by reaſon of this intereſt: and ſo it is in the work of faith alſo, and the ground of it is this, (1) becauſe all the glory that God hath by us here, is when he is exalted in our hearts; for Gods glory is in the hearts of his Saints, as all their melody is in their hearts, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.19. when all things in the inward man are in tune, and ſet right, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.2. <hi>He is my God and I will exalt him.</hi> Now as our apprehenſions do riſe in the conſideration of the glory of any thing that is in God, God hath the more diſtinct glory thereby; for as he hath given us variety of ordinances, and he will be honoured by us in them all; ſo he hath propounded to our faith diſtinct ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and he will be honoured by our faith in them all; for as you heard, the glory that God hath in this world chiefly is in the hearts of the Saints, they only do glorifie him <hi>actively,</hi> all things elſe do it but <hi>occaſionally,</hi> that is, by giving them an occaſion to glorifie him. (2) Becauſe there is a diſtinct ſweetneſs and vertue that comes from every one of theſe, when the ſoul is diſtinctly drawn out to them, and they are diſtinctly exerciſed: as <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10. ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>That I may know him, and the power of his reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, being made conformable unto his ſufferings,</hi> &amp;c. When a man looks upon the death of Chriſt, there is a vertue will come out of it; and if upon the ſufferings of Chriſt, there is a vertue will come out of them all, and they have all of them their peculiar and proper vertue upon the ſoul.

                     </gap>, and ſo the Saints have a great inheritance to glory in, they are heirs of promiſes, yea they inherit all things; but the main of Chriſts glory is his inheritance in the perſon of the Father, and that ſhould be alſo the glory of the Saints; and here conſider, (1) that the high advancement of the creature lyes in union with the perſons, as the higheſt advancement of the humane nature of Chriſt lyes in the perſonal Union; the grace of Union is far greater than the grace of Unction, that he was made one with the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity; and the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our nature is more by our myſtical Union with the Perſon of Chriſt, than in all the benefits we receive from him; but there is a higher union that this tends to, and that is an union with all the perſons in the Trinity thereby, for <hi>communio fundatur in unione.</hi> Now having communion with all the perſons, it argues that we have an union with them all; and as we have a higher union with the perſon of the Son than the Angels have, ſo we have a nearer union with the Father, and with the Spirit alſo; and herein lyes the greateſt exaltation. (2) There is more in union with the perſons, than there is in all other benefits whatſoever, and all other intereſts: as there is more in the perſon of Chriſt than there is in all the benefits of Chriſt; ſo there is more in giving of the perſon of Chriſt, than in giving of all the benefits that he beſtows. Thus there is more in our title to the perſons, than in all other intereſts whatſoever, whether we have an intereſt in promiſes, in creatures, in ordinances, nay it is more in ſome reſpect than an intereſt in Attributes; for under the firſt Covenant the Attributes were after a ſort made over to <hi>Adam,</hi> that they ſhould all work for him, they were his portion; but under the ſecond Covenant it is that the intereſt in the perſons comes in; for if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood, he had had an intereſt in God in common, whatever was in the Nature of God, all the Attributes of his Nature ſhould have been his; but it is the ſecond Covenant that brings in union with the Son of God, that gives us a diſtinct union with the Father and with the Spirit; and therefore it is a perſonal intereſt that is the great mercy and glory of the new Covenant. (3) It is our title unto the perſon that gives us a title unto all the benefits: as it is in our union with Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12. <hi>He that has the Son has life,</hi> it's our union with the Son that gives us
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:52030:189"/> a title unto life for him; for the Covenant is matrimonial, and it is the union with the perſon only that intitles the woman to her husbands honour and eſtate: ſo it's in this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, having an intereſt in all the perſons gives a man a title unto all the promiſes and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the priviledges of the Saints; and therefore the <hi>jus haereditarium</hi> of the Saints unto all other good things from God lyes in this, that they have an union with all the perſons; for they that are not intitled unto the perſons, do in vain hope to intitle themſelves to the benefits. (4) This gives a man a threefold title and intereſt, [1] in all the Attributes, [2] in the Divine Nature, [3] in their actings: for as they are all made over unto the Saints, ſo they know that all theſe attributes are to be found in all the perſons. There is in the Father infinite wiſdom, and infinite power, and infinite mercy, and infinite grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo there is in the Son alſo, for the attributes of the nature are in common to them all, they having all of them but one and the ſame ſimple and undivided Eſſence; and it is glorious to a Saint to ſee all the attributes in them all, and thereby he is aſſured, that in all the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Father he will improve all the attributes, and ſo it is in all the actings of the Son and the Spirit alſo, and ſo they become ours in the actings of them by reaſon of our intereſt in all the three perſons. (5) This is the proper ground of our communion with God: wherein lyes the ſweetneſs of a Chriſtians life here, but mainly in that fellowſhip that he hath with God, that he walks with God, and that he is not alone, but the Father is with him, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Now all communion is perſonal, and is a mutual intercourſe between per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with the Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And there is a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. It's true, we have an inheritance in attributes and in promiſes, but we cannot properly be ſaid to have fellowſhip with him but in regard of the perſons: <hi>Adam</hi> had in his creation an inheritance in all the creatures, but yet he could not have communion with them, there was none meet for fellowſhip with him but <hi>Eve:</hi> ſo it's here, there is nothing but a perſon that a man can have communion with. It's true, our communion is in things; as we have communion with Chriſt in his righteouſneſs and in his priviledges, in his graces, in his victories, that is, we have a ſhare together with him in them all, and they are as truly ours as they are his, according unto our neceſſity; but yet remember, our communion is with the perſon of Chriſt, not with the benefits: ſo it is in this alſo, we have a communion with Father, Son, and Spirit in the attributes of the Nature, ſo that they are as truly ours according to the tenour, and for the ends of the new Covenant, as they are his; but ſtill our union and communion is with the perſons in them, therein doth properly the foundation lye: as if a husband marry a wife, ſhe ſhall have a communion with him, that is, a common ſhare in his honour and in his eſtate, in whatever is his; but yet the communion that ſhe hath is with the perſon of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.<note place="margin">

                     </gap>, he deceives a man by falſe reaſonings; ſo alſo he endeavours to deceive a man in matter of his ſtate, that he might deceive himſelf by falſe reaſonings alſo: and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground it mainly is, that there is that extraordinary averſneſs in the hearts of men unto the duty of ſelf-examination, and <hi>a far greater averſneſs to the examination of a mans ſtate, than of his actions;</hi> for there are many men that will make conſcience to review their actions and conſider their ways, and yet theſe very men are willing to go upon a ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the matter of their ſpiritual ſtates, and to be content to take that for granted, though it be the ground of all. And here we are to conſider alſo, that many that are true Believers may not know that there is a diſtinct intereſt in the perſons to be had; they in general do believe in God, and cloſe with Chriſt, who is offered them in the promiſe, but as for ſuch a diſtinct title unto all the perſons, it is a thing that they are not acquainted with; it ſeems it was this that Chriſt reproved in his Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Ye believe in God, believe alſo in me:</hi> their faith in the acting of it was not ſo diſtinct and particular as it ought to have been. As it is in witneſſing, there is many a man that never knew that there was a diſtinct witneſs of all the perſons in the hearts of the Saints, and therefore they did never look out for any ſuch thing; ſo it is in the point of faith alſo: but now this is a truth diſcovered to you, and the Lord will expect the fruit of Goſpel-diſcoveries, he will come and demand fruit of his Vineyard, and he doth expect it; <hi>he it is with whom,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 4.13.</note>

                  <p n="1">(1) We are to conſider, that the way by which we can come to have an intereſt in all the perſons, is by cloſing with the Son; for it is our union with the Son, that as it gives us a title unto all good things, ſo it gives us in the firſt place an union with all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and it intitles us unto them all; it is <hi>he that hath the Son hath the Father alſo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.23.</note> 
                     <hi>and he that hath not the Son, hath not the Father:</hi> for it is only the bleſſing of the ſecond Covenant, and it comes upon none but thoſe that are in Covenant, as the promiſes come upon none but thoſe that are heirs of promiſe; therefore we ſhould firſt inquire, whether we be one with the Son or no. Now there is no union with him but by believing in him; for it is <hi>the eating the fleſh of Chriſt, and drinking his blood that gives us life by him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 6.54.</note> Now though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving be an act of the whole ſoul, for the ſubject of <hi>faith</hi> is the whole ſoul, <hi>with the heart man believes,</hi> yet it is ſpecially ſeated in the will; as unbelief alſo is ſpecially ſeated there. There is a double infidelity: (1) <hi>Purae negationis, of pure negation,</hi> which ſome have ſaid is no ſin; but yet if there is a command to believe, then bare <hi>not-believing</hi> is a ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the tranſgreſſion of the Law. (2) <hi>Pravae diſpoſitionis, of depraved diſpoſition;</hi> and that lyes mainly in the will. Now when the will opens aright, it is unto two things: [1] It does conſent to receive and accept of Chriſt upon his own terms, not only Chriſt with his righteouſneſs, but Chriſt with his graces, not only Chriſt with his priviledges, but Chriſt with his inconveniencies, Chriſt to all the ends for which the Father hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained him, he would have him glorified in them all in his heart. [2] With the ſame hand of faith that he doth receive whole Chriſt, he doth give up whole ſelf unto Chriſt again, ſo that he is his own no more, but put out of his own power for ever; and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth in this, <hi>that I am my beloveds as well as my beloved is mine;</hi> he would have his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in him, and he would enjoy nothing apart from him for ever, he would live in him, and bear fruit in him, and work for him, and be into him, and that to eternity; for he ſaith to him, as <hi>Ruth</hi> to her mother-in-law, <hi>Where thou goeſt I will go, where thou lodgeſt I will lodge, thy people ſhall be my people, thy God my God, and where thou dyeſt I will dye,</hi> &amp;c. Where there hath been ſuch an acceptation and ſuch a reſignation, there the work of faith is wrought with power, and he that is thus one with the Son, is thereby madelone with the Father alſo; for our union is by him, as our acceſs and communion alſo is all by him with the Father.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) If a man be intitled unto the perſons, there will be drawings out of his heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards each perſon: for there is an impreſſion of the love of them all left upon the ſoul; We love him, becauſe he loved us firſt; and this love will warm our hearts with love again; there will be the workings of it in the ſoul, though there be not the witneſſing;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.19.</note> for <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. there is a good work begun, and it's begun by all the perſons, and it is to glorifie the perſons mainly in the hearts of Believers, and therefore ſuch workings the Lord will draw forth in them: O that ever God the Father ſhould give his Son to me! <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. <hi>God ſo loved the world!</hi> and that I ſhould be called the Son of God, that the Son ſhould lay down his life for me, ſhould bear my ſins and my ſorrows, that his Spirit ſhould abide in me, inlightning mine eyes, renewing me in the ſpirit of my mind; there will be
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:52030:190"/> ſuch a ſpiritual warmth wrought in the ſoul towards all theſe perſons, becauſe there is a principle of the love of them all kindled in the ſoul. But yet,</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) There will never be the fulneſs of aſſurance, till the perſons that have given you an intereſt in themſelves, do alſo themſelves witneſs their intereſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. and they will ſurely do ſo to all thoſe that wait for them; the Father will ſay, <hi>I am thy Father,</hi> and the Son ſay, <hi>I am thy Saviour,</hi> and the Spirit, <hi>I am thine:</hi> therefore exerciſe faith upon your intereſt in all the perſons, and in particular upon your intereſt in God the Father, and be much in communion with the Father; ſeeing communion is perſonal, and there is a diſtinct intereſt in all the perſons, therefore a diſtinct communion; that which was the happineſs of theſe perſons communion, and the infinite ſatisfaction that they took one in another, that ſhall be thy happineſs and thy portion for ever.</p>
                  <p n="3">§. 3. We are to exerciſe faith upon all the perſons in this manner made over under the ſecond Covenant, and to live upon this principle in all our ways. (1) That they are all of them objects of faith is clear: for the ultimate object of faith is God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. Now as we are to take in the whole Scripture, as <hi>objectum immediatum, the immediate object,</hi> and every part of the Scripture is to be believed as an object of faith; ſo the whole God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, all the attributes of God, and all the perſons in the Godhead are by faith to be reſted upon; for there are, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.10. <gap reason="foreign">

(2) We are to worſhip them all, though not as apart one from another, yet as in our apprehenſion diſtinguiſhed; and we are to give unto them diſtinct worſhip, as Chriſt ſays, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.23. <hi>The time cometh, that you ſhall neither in this mountain, nor in Jeruſalem worſhip the Father; he that will worſhip God, muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth; for the Father ſeeks ſuch to worſhip him,</hi> &amp;c. Now worſhip is twofold, either <hi>cultus naturalis, qui ex ipſa Dei natura pendet, natural worſhip,</hi> &amp;c. There is no man that did ever worſhip a God, but he did acknowledge, that this God he was to believe in, and hope in, love, and pray to, and to hear and obey him in all things: and there is a <hi>cultus inſtitutus; qui ex liberrima Dei voluntate pendet, &amp;c. inſtituted worſhip, which depends on the will of God.</hi> Now the higheſt act of worſhip is in believing, and it's unto this that all the Inſtitutions, which are but <hi>media cultûs, means of worſhip</hi> are properly ſubordinate; for <hi>cultus inſtitutus medii locum tantùm ſupplet ad cultum primarium:</hi> being to worſhip the perſons we muſt give to each of them that which is the main of worſhip, and that is to believe in them. (3) It is from the objects of faith that the life of the ſoul comes in, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 38.16. <hi>By theſe things men live, and in all theſe things is the life of my ſpirit:</hi> for the Prophet <hi>Eſaias</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Take a lump of figs, and lay it upon the boil, and he ſhall recover,</hi> by this promiſe I ſhall live, and many others that come after ſhall live upon the promiſes by this experiment that I have had, and found of them; for faith is <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>That all the labour of the man is for his mouth:</hi> it's from the meat that a man eats, that the ſtrength of his body is derived; and therefore Chriſt, as the object of faith, ſaith, <hi>That his fleſh is meat indeed, and his blood drink indeed,</hi> it notes ſtrength and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment comes from the object of faith, and the way of conveyance is by union; it is by ſucking the ſap and the ſweet of it, <hi>crede &amp; manducâſti,</hi> and if any object of faith do not contribute its part, and the ſoul lives not upon it, it will in its ſtrength decay; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>we live by the faith of the Son of God, Gal.</hi> 2.20. becauſe it is from the direct acts of faith that life comes in: and here are two things to be ſpoken to: (1) <hi>What the objects of faith are that the ſoul is to take in, in the making over of each perſon under the ſecond Covenant?</hi> (2) <hi>What acts of faith the ſoul is to put forth upon them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The objects of faith that the ſoul is to take in in each of the perſons are theſe: (1) The perſons themſelves, we are to believe <hi>the record of them all,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.10. Joh. 5.45. <hi>we are to hear and learn of the Father,</hi> and <hi>we are to believe in the Son: To him give all the Prophets witneſs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.6.</note> Act. 10.43. <hi>that whoſoever believes in him ſhall have remiſſion of ſins, Joh.</hi> 3.16. and we are to believe in the Spirit, it is the Spirit that bears witneſs, becauſe the Spirit is truth; and ſo we are to come unto them in duties, in prayer, and hearing, and in all acts of worſhip; and the ground of it is, becauſe we are to believe in him; for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pray to him in whom they have not believed,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.14.</note> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. Now though the benefit that we have by all theſe perſons is exceeding great, the Father adopts and juſtifies us by the imputation of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and the remiſſion of ſins, and the Son is Jehovah our righteouſneſs, and he gives us power to become the ſons of God, and the Spirit is the bond of our union, the principle of our ſanctification, and the guide of our way; yet the ground of all this intereſt in their benefits is our intereſt in their perſons: ſo that as our intereſt in the Mediator, and union with his perſon is far greater than all the benefits
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:52030:190"/> that we receive by him, becauſe it is the fountain from which they do all flow, and the root upon which they do all grow, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12. ſo it's here alſo, intereſt in the perſons is the foundation of all our intereſt in their benefits; for if we had no title unto the perſons, we could have no benefit by them, or any part thereof: and therefore as they are perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal promiſes that are the great promiſes of the Goſpel; ſo they are perſonal intereſts that are the great priviledges of the Goſpel, and that in which the main of the life of a Saint lyes: ſo that as when Chriſt is ſet forth by God the Father as a propitiation lifted up in the Goſpel, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="2">(2) The ſoul is to reſt upon all the promiſes that in Scripture are made concerning theſe perſons: there are promiſes that have a peculiar reſpect unto them all. [1] There are promiſes that ſpecially concern the Father, which though they be formally made unto the Son, yet it is with ſpecial reſpect unto the Saints: as the promiſe of giving Chriſt unto their ſouls, and nouriſhment and life by him; for he ſays,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.32.</note> 
                     <hi>Moſes gave you not the bread that came down from heaven, my Father gives you the true bread:</hi> promiſes of juſtification by him, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53.11. <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many,</hi> that is as much as to ſay, as many as believe in him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins, and a promiſe of guidance, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.20. <hi>Behold I ſend my Angel before you.</hi> They were in a ſtrait; for they were in the wilderneſs where there was no way; now the Father doth promiſe the Son ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take their guidance, and it is not a promiſe that is peculiar unto thoſe times only, though there was ſomething peculiar in it. And there is a promiſe of gifts,<note place="margin">Acts 1.4.</note> 
                     <hi>Wait for the promiſe of the Father.</hi> The extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt that were to be poured out to fit men for office in thoſe times, it's called the promiſe of the Father: and the promiſe alſo of preſervation and perſeverance, <hi>My Father that gave them me is greater than all,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 10.29.</note> 
                     <hi>and no man can pluck them out of my Fathers hand.</hi> [2] There are ſome promiſes that do more eſpecially belong unto the Son, as that of grace, and a continual ſupply; <hi>he ſhall go in and out and find paſture;</hi> and ſays Chriſt, <hi>I am come that they may have life, and have it more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly;</hi> and a promiſe of a conſtant preſence, <hi>I will dwell in them, and walk amongst them;</hi>

                     <hi>what concord hath Chriſt with Belial?

[3] There are ſome promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that in a more ſpecial manner reſpect the holy Spirit: he has promiſed them a ſpirit of ſanctification, and he will purge the filth of the daughter of <hi>Sion</hi> by a ſpirit of burning, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 4.4. promiſes of direction, <hi>The Spirit ſhall lead you into all truth, Joh.</hi> 16.13. he ſhall undertake to be the guide of your way, and you ſhall hear a voice crying behind you, This is the way, walk in it: a ſpirit of liberty alſo you ſhall have;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.17.</note> for <hi>where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty;</hi> and a ſpirit of victory, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 59.19. when the enemy doth break in as a floud, the Spirit of the Lord ſhall lift up a ſtandard againſt him, ſo that <hi>they ſhall conquer, not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, Zac.</hi> 4 6. Now all theſe lead a man unto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Spirit, and his intereſt in him, as ſo many lines into a centre; for as all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes do lead a man to union with Chriſt, by which means he becomes an heir of promiſe, ſo do all the promiſes lead a man to an intereſt in his perſon, without which he can lay no claim unto the promiſe that is made by any of the perſons, for they are not univerſal, and made unto all; but as the promiſes of Chriſt belong unto thoſe that are one with him, ſo all the promiſes of the perſons belong only unto thoſe that have an intereſt in them; and therefore we are to caſt our ſelves upon the perſons for the accompliſhment of the promiſes.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) Faith is to reſt upon the love of them all; for though they are eſſentially one, and therefore have but one will, yet as they are perſonally diſtinguiſhed, ſo they are three, and have diſtinct wills and diſtinct loves; and therefore Chriſt diſtinguiſhes between his will and the Fathers will: <hi>I am come not to do my own will, but the will of him that ſent me; not my will, but thy will be done; eſſentially</hi> his will and the Fathers are one, but they are <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally</hi> diſtinguiſhed: ſo they have eſſentially one love; but if we look upon them as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo they have each of them his own proper and peculiar love: <hi>He that loves me ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him: if any man love me, my Father will love him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 14.21.</note> &amp;c. ſo
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:52030:191" rendition="simple:additions"/> that faith is not only to cloſe with the love of God in general, as it is an Attribute of the Divine Nature, as his Wiſdom and Holineſs, Mercy and Power are; but faith is alſo to cloſe with the love of each of the perſons, as they are relatively diſtinguiſhed one from another, the love of the Father, and the love of the Son and Spirit: and as it is the love of God eſſentially, that is the ground of all that God has wrought for us, it was his <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="4">(4) Faith ſhould reſt upon the appropriated acts of each of theſe perſons, and rely upon them for the performance of them. We have formerly heard, that each perſon hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken ſome ſpecial and peculiar acts for mens ſalvation, as [1] the work of Vocation, Adoption, Juſtification, Preſervation, Glorification; for it is your Fathers pleaſure to give you the Kingdom, they are all of them undertaken by God the Father. And [2] the work of Satisfaction, Preſentation, Oblation, Interceſſion, Conqueſt, Judgment, all theſe the Son has undertaken. [3] The work of Sanctification, Direction, Conſolation, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, they are all of them undertaken by the Spirit. Now we are not only to rely upon the eſſential faithfulneſs of God for the performance of it,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.17.</note> but upon the perſonal faithfulneſs of each of theſe undertakers, for they are all of them ingaged in it: and here is a farther and higher conſideration to be taken in the acts of the perſons, and they are of two ſorts. [1] Acts <hi>ad intrà,</hi> internal acts; and they are acts of nature, which are acts one towards another, as the generation of the Father in reſpect of the Son, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, as from them both. [2] There are acts <hi>ad extrà,</hi> which are terminated in the creatures, and are meerly acts of will: now faith is not only by this means to be exerciſed, and taſte the ſweetneſs of the acts of will <hi>ad extrà,</hi> but the acts of nature <hi>ad intrà:</hi> for I have an intereſt in that Father, as the Father that did from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity beget the Son, and I have an intereſt in that Son that was begotten by the Father; ſo that thoſe acts of nature that were of God before the world was, they have all ſome reſpect unto me, and I can taſte a ſweetneſs in them all; that as I have not only an intereſt in the abſolute perfections of God, which are his Attributes, but in the relative perfections of God alſo, which reſpect the perſons; ſo I have not only an intereſt in, and benefit by all the actings of the Atrributes of God, but by the eternal actings of the perſons alſo, that we may ſee how high it reaches, and that there is nothing in God but it is as truly for our good, as it is for his own glory, therefore we may rejoyce in them all.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5) A mans faith ſhould expect all the Attributes of God to be diſtinctly exerciſed for him by all the perſons: a man has an intereſt in them all, in all the works that they do put forth; for as they are three in their ſubſiſtence, ſo they are but one in their Eſſence; and therefore all the Attributes of God come in unto them all: the Son thinks it no rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery to be equal with the Father,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.6.</note> for he is found in the form of God, that is, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, ſubſiſting in the nature or eſſence of God; and therefore Divines do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, when they prove the Deity of the Son and Spirit, ſhew, that the Attributes of God are in Scripture given unto them, as <hi>Eſa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Wonderful Counſellor, the mighty God, the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Father, Prince of peace,</hi> that's given to the Son; and to the Spirit is given <hi>Omnipotency, Omnipreſence,</hi> and <hi>Omniſcience,</hi> &amp;c. Now when the Father comes to work, he has the power of God, the wiſdom of God, the holineſs of God put forth for the accompliſhment of his work: and ſo have the Son and Spirit alſo; and therefore we ſee that the Son could not miſcarry in any thing that he did; and though he dyed, yet it was impoſſible that he ſhould be held by death,<note place="margin">Acts 2.</note> becauſe he had the power of the Godhead to carry him through; and ſo it is with the Perſons in all their operations and undertakings for men in the work of our ſalvation; and therefore it is good for a man not only to exerciſe faith upon the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of the Divine Nature in common, as they are infinite and abſolute perfections, but as thoſe Attributes are to be found in each of the perſons, and to be exerciſed for us in all their appropriated actions; and by this means the Attributes of the nature are made over not only by the Eſſence, but alſo that they ſhall be all of them exerciſed by each perſon, acting according to their own acts which they have undertaken, and ſo we have an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the acting of the Attributes for us in a threefold way, and a threefold cord is not broken.</p>
                  <p n="6">(6) As it is the recumbency of faith, ſo it ſhould be in the aſſurance of faith alſo, it ſhould diſtinctly cloſe with them all in their witneſſing, as well as in their working, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.6, 7.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.6, 7.</note> 
                     <hi>There are three that bear record in heaven:</hi> it is not only a teſtimony to the truth of the Goſpel, but it is a teſtimony alſo given unto the ſtate of the Saints; <hi>for they have the witneſs in themſelves,</hi> for it is, that <hi>they may know that they have eternal life, verſ.</hi> 13. which could not be unleſs the teſtimony were given in the heart, and a mans ſtate put out

Now though they be one in Eſſence, and though their teſtimony do agree in one, yet they are three in their witneſs in the word and in the heart: now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, <hi>in the mouth of two or three witneſſes every word ſhall be eſtabliſhed:</hi> we receive the witneſs of man, but the witneſs of God is greater; the ſame God who hath but a few witneſſes amongſt men, but <hi>two witneſſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 11.3.</note> yet he will not let a mans aſſurance go without a full teſtimony, there ſhall be two claſſes of witneſſes, ſome on Earth, and ſome in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and they ſhall be three of each of them: therefore as in acts of recumbency we are to cloſe with the love of all the perſons, ſo in acts of aſſurance we are to cloſe with the witneſs of all the perſons; and thus we ſee that there are diſtinct objects of faith upon which it is to work in them all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now let us come to conſider the acts of faith that are diſtinctly to be put forth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them all: as 1. There is to be a fiducial knowledge hereof, that the perſons are made over to us: for as faith without works is dead, ſo faith without knowledge is blind; therefore faith is commonly ſet forth by knowledge in the Scripture, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. <hi>ult.</hi> and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9. <hi>To know him, and be found in him,</hi> &amp;c. But it is not every knowledge, but that which is deſcribed, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1. <hi>A knowledge of the myſtery of God, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of Chriſt,</hi> a knowledge that draws an acknowledgment with it, that carries the conſent of the ſoul with it, and he ſits down under it, and lies under the power thereof, a <hi>ſapida ſcientia,</hi> a knowledge of a truth that lets in the ſavour of the goodneſs of it with the truth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſoul is diſtinctly to caſt it ſelf by diſtinct thoughts upon each of theſe perſons: as when a ſoul comes to Chriſt, he ſees his need of him, that he is undone without him, he ſees the excellency that is in him, and thereupon he doth leave himſelf with Chriſt, and will look out for ſalvation in no other, there is an <hi>excluſive reſolution</hi> againſt all other ways, and a full determination to go this way only, and <hi>if I periſh, here I will periſh;</hi> ſo when a ſoul ſees all this, and ſees his need of the perſons, and the glory that is not only in Chriſt, but in the Father and the Spirit, and ſees that without an intereſt in them he is undone; for elſe there are no benefits by them; thereupon he doth diſtinctly reſign himſelf unto each of them: for as all the promiſes of the Goſpel being diſtinct objects of faith have not their due honour, unleſs we exerciſe diſtinct acts of faith upon them; ſo it is true alſo of all the perſons much more; becauſe Chriſt is ſet forth as an object of faith, therefore we rely upon him; ſo we ſhould upon the Father and Spirit alſo; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt looks upon it as a diſhonour, that being ſet forth to them, they did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly believe in him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Faith draws virtue from all the objects of it: <hi>Eſa.</hi> 66.11. <hi>It will ſuck, and be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the breaſts of conſolation.</hi> It's true, that we are now in a ſtate of childhood,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.12.</note> our manhood is to come, but yet there are breaſts of conſolation agreeable unto our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as Chriſt cannot be touched by faith but virtue comes out of him,<note place="margin">Luke 8.46.</note> there is a power and efficacy that goes out of him, there is life to be drawn from the living Father, and from the Son, and from the Spirit; a man can exerciſe no act of faith upon any of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of faith, but he can find there is an influence that it hath upon the man that believes; as it is in all the acts of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9, 10. ſo it is in this much more; how ſhould a man rejoyce to ſee the influence of each perſon upon his ſoul?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is alſo an act of reſignation; for faith hath two hands, one to receive, and the other to return: <hi>I am my beloveds, and my beloved is mine,</hi> ſays the believing ſoul:<note place="margin">Cant. 6.3.</note> a man doth as well give up himſelf to God, as he doth receive an intereſt in God. <hi>David</hi> ſays as well, <hi>Lord I am thy ſervant, as O Lord thou art my God;</hi> and therefore a man ſhould give up himſelf to the praiſe and glory of Father, Son, and Spirit; for to be baptized in the name of them all, is for a man to give up himſelf unto the obedience of them all: there is a judging and reaſoning alſo in faith; ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Becauſe we thus judge,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.13, 14.</note> 
                     <hi>if one dyed for all, then were all dead:</hi> if the Father, Son, and Spirit give up themſelves to work for our good, and we have an intereſt in them all, how much more ſhould we give up our ſelves to be to the praiſe and glory of them all, and ſtill keep up the eye of our faith open to ſee the Lord making himſelf over to us, and the ear of faith open to hear and receive the teſtimony that is given, and be not indulgent to the unbelief, doubtings, and the miſgiving of your own ſpirits, receive the witneſs of God within you, and having received a teſtimony of thy intereſt, then triumph in God, for there is a triumph of faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. bleſſed be God the Father by Chriſt, who was rich in love, loved me, and gave himſelf for me, glory be to the Father, Son, and Spirit.</p>

                  <p n="4">§. 4. Here we will conſider, (1) <hi>That there is a diſtinct Communion with them all,</hi> that a Believer may and ought to have with all the perſons grounded upon his intereſt in them all. (2) <hi>Wherein this Communion doth conſiſt, and what are the actings of it.</hi> (3) <hi>Give you ſome arguments that may perſwade the people of God to be much in the improvement thereof;</hi> that as you have a fellowſhip with Chriſt and with the Saints, and you look upon that as ſweet, ſo you would not neglect this, which is the higheſt fellowſhip that you do attain by faith, and is the end of all your union and communion whatſoever.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That there is a diſtinct fellowſhip and communion to be had with all the perſons.</hi> That will clearly appear from 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> ſo that we have not only a communion with Chriſt the Mediator, but through him with the Father: and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. we do read of a <hi>fellowſhip with the Spirit alſo,</hi> which muſt be mutual; he hath a fellowſhip with us and we with him; we are ſaid to have acceſs unto the Father, which are terms of communion, and that diſtinct communion which we have with all the perſons,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.22.</note> as well as they one with the other; and therefore 'tis ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22. <hi>Ye are come unto mount Sion,</hi> &amp;c. Now to come unto the three perſons, notes (1) faith in them, and ſo we come unto Chriſt, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, Mat.</hi> 11.29. that is, that believe in him.

                     </gap>, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.12. Here to come to them is to be taken into favour and fellowſhip with them all, as appears in theſe particulars. (1) <hi>We are come unto mount Sion, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jeruſalem,</hi> that is the Church of Chriſt, under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, called therefore <hi>Jeruſalem that is above, Gal.</hi> 4.26. and in alluſion to it we read of a <hi>new Jeruſalem that comes down from God out of heaven,</hi> Rev. 21.1, 2. (2) <hi>To the Church of the firſt-born, whoſe names are written in heaven,</hi> that is, we are taken into fellowſhip with all the Elect of God, we do make up one body with them. (3) <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto God the Judge of all:</hi> we have not only communion therefore with Chriſt, as Mediator, and with the Angels and Saints, but we have a further communion, and that is with God himſelf, which is a term of his Eſſence when it is put without a term of reſtriction, and refers us to all the perſons in the Godhead, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Wherein doth this Communion and fellowſhip conſiſt?</hi> I ſhall deſcribe it to you accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fellowſhip that is between men, from whence this Metaphor is borrowed. 1. The great communion that perſons have is in the love one of another; that was the great thing in which <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> had communion, and not ſo much in their perſons; for <hi>David</hi> lived a perſecuted life,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 1.26.</note> but he was ſure of <hi>Jonathans</hi> love, <hi>Thy love to me was wonderful, paſſing the love of women:</hi> therefore is no fellowſhip like that that is by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing of love; for love is the ſouls byas, it carries it with it whereſoever it goes, it is an interchanging of hearts, an interchanging of love: <hi>tranſit amans in amatum, the lover paſſeth into the beloved.</hi> Now though the Father be in Heaven, yet he loves not, though
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:52030:192"/> we be ſtrangers from the Lord, while we are in the body, yet <hi>the Father himſelf loves you,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21, 23. <hi>I will love him, and my Father ſhall love him;</hi> and though we be upon earth, yet we <hi>can walk in his love:</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8. <hi>Whom having not ſeen you love, and though now you ſee him not, yet believing ye rejoyce with joy unſpeakable, &amp;c.</hi> and this is the communion that we have with the Angels, though they are Spirits, and we ſee them not, yet we know that they bear a tender love to the Saints; for they do as Nurſes bear them in their arms: and in this was the fellowſhip of the perſons one to another much ſeen, they delighted themſelves in the love of each other, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. <hi>ult. This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed;</hi> and that is the communion that the Saints have with Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.1. Joh. 3.16.</note> 
                     <hi>he is my beloved,</hi> Eſa. 5.1. <hi>I will ſing to my beloved a ſong of my beloved touching his vineyard,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he it is whom my ſoul loveth, my beloved is mine and I am his:</hi> and this was the great thing that delighted the Lord from Eternity; <hi>his delights were with the ſons of men,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 8.30.</note> his thoughts of love were his delight towards them: and as the Lord had communion with our love in the thoughts of it, ſo may we have communion with his love alſo; and therefore we do read of <hi>walking in love,</hi> and <hi>dwelling in love,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.16.</note> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.16. that upon which the ſoul is conſtantly ſet, it is ſaid to dwell upon it, <hi>Job</hi> 17.11. <hi>the thoughts</hi> are called <hi>the poſſeſſions of the heart,</hi> that which the thoughts do dwell upon, the heart is ſaid to poſſeſs. Now as the Lord is ſaid to <hi>inhabit the praiſes of Iſrael,</hi> becauſe they praiſe him conſtantly; and therefore he is ſaid <hi>to dwell in praiſes;</hi> ſo becauſe his love doth daily refreſh ſinners, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ſaid <hi>to dwell in love</hi> alſo: as a man hath communion with Satan by thoughts, the goings forth of his heart are after him and his ways; ſo a man hath communion with each perſon alſo by the goings forth of the ſoul to them: there is therefore a communion by interchanging of love, and they that ſo do interchange hearts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a communion in their actings one for another; for there are mutual offices of love that this <hi>amor benevolentia</hi> doth bring forth, and the ſoul is never ſatisfied in either of them. God the Father acts in love in giving his Son, and making over himſelf to thy ſoul in juſtifying thy perſon, and adopting thee to be his own ſon, and eſtating upon thee a Kingdom; <hi>for it is the Fathers pleaſure to give you a kingdom:</hi> and all theſe acts of love the ſoul opens, and conſiders them apart, and ſays, <hi>What ſhall I return unto the Lord for all theſe things?</hi> and then love doth unlock the heart, and it ſaith, the love of bounty from the father calls upon me for a love of duty; is any thing too much for him, that hath done ſo much for me? and then in all theſe he taſtes the love of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> for it is ſhed abroad in his heart, and the ſoul in the gift taſtes the love of the giver; and therefore the ſoul is willing to ſpeak for him, and act for him, and live to him, and dye for him: <hi>What ſhall I return to the Lord for all his benefits?</hi> And then his own poverty comes in with bitterneſs to him, he is willing beyond his ability, he would be bountiful, but he hath it not; and therefore he doth as it's ſaid of <hi>Aeſchinus,</hi> that when he ſaw other hearers of <hi>Socrates</hi> give gifts to him, he ſaith, <hi>Nihil te dignum quod dare poſſum invenio, &amp; hoc modo pauperem me eſſe ſentio; itaq, dono tibi quod unum habeo, meipſum, &amp;c. I have nothing worthy of thee to give, but I give my ſelf:</hi> and the ſoul ſaith, as <hi>Cicero</hi> to <hi>Lentulus, Caeteris in officiis omnibus ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facere poſſum, nunquam mihiipſi, &amp;c.</hi> And this alſo is the communion that Chriſt hath with the Father, the Father ſays, <hi>Sit thou at my right hand, and I will give thee the heathen for an inheritance,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>I will hold thee by the hand:</hi> and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I muſt do my Fathers buſineſs, and it's my meat and drink.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. They have a communion in viſitations; for we ſay, that amongſt men friendſhip is maintained by viſits, and increaſed thereby; and ſo it is between God and the Saints alſo, there is indeed a viſitation in wrath, as the Lord ſaith, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Shall I not viſit for theſe things?</hi> and there is a viſitation in mercy and compaſſion, <hi>Zac.</hi> 10.3. <hi>The Lord hath viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his flock, the houſe of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horſe in the battel,</hi> &amp;c. Luk. 1.68. <hi>He hath viſited and redeemed his people.</hi> Now God is ſaid to viſit us, when he comes to manifeſt his love, and to beſtow upon us ſweet and ſpiritual bleſſings, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.1. <hi>I am come into my garden,</hi> &amp;c. and when the ſoul comes to God of purpoſe to enjoy communion with him; for we can never come to God but we have need of him, and when we are moſt ſenſible of our wants, and mans intereſt carries him to God; but ſurely to deſire to ſee God for himſelf is an act of pure friendſhip, <hi>to ſee thy power, O God, and thy glory; for thy loving-kindneſs is better than life.</hi> When a ſoul is thus taken with a ſight of God, that if a man had no dependence, and were put into a condition as perfect as the Angels, and had need of nothing, yet then to come into his preſence, and to behold his face, becauſe we delight in him, this is properly an act of friendſhip and of familiarity that ſhould be between God and the Saints.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is an imparting of counſels between the perſons: Chriſt was given out of the boſom of the Father. There is not any diſcovery that is made to the Saints,<note place="margin">Joh. 1.18.</note> but it comes
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:52030:193"/> out of the ſame boſom; <hi>Shall I hide from Abraham the thing that I mean to do? Gen.</hi> 18. ſurely the Lord will do nothing, but he reveals his ſecrets to his Prophets, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.7. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.15. <hi>The Lord told Samuel in his ear;</hi> there is a <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thumim</hi> for the Saints ſtill, and the Lord gives them a ſpiritual skill here to make uſe of it, ſo as to know the ſecrets of the Almighty; <hi>We took ſweet counſel together,</hi> &amp;c. and the Saints alſo do impart their counſels to God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.15. <hi>I have poured out my ſoul before the Lord.</hi> There are indeed a generation of men that <hi>dig deep to hide counſel from the Lord.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 29.15.</note> It is true, that there is no ſecret hid from him, but it is their endeavour ſo to carry it, as they might not only blind the eyes of man, but of God alſo; but a Saint opens his heart to him, there is no ſecret that he is willing to hide from God, but there are ſuch ſighs and groans that he doth open when he hath to do with him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There are mutual delights in their intereſt one in another, and they do love to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it, <hi>The Lords portion is his people, Iſrael is the lot of my inheritance, the Lord is my portion, ſays my ſoul:</hi> and ſays God, <hi>They are the firſt-fruits of the creatures unto me,</hi> and they are thoſe that do conſecrate all the reſt to me, without which all the reſt were profane, and have a curſe upon them, <hi>&amp;c. O Lord, thou art my Lord,</hi> ſays the ſoul, <hi>early will I praiſe thee; I am thy ſervant, and the ſon of thy handmaid, Eſa.</hi> 4.4, 5. A man often glories in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt here in this world; but herein doth the Saint glory, that he can ſay, <hi>I am the Lords, and that he can call himſelf by the name of Jacob, and can ſubſcribe with his hand to the Lord:</hi> and a great part of the fellowſhip of love is in a mutual profeſſion of their intereſt each in other: <hi>And I will be yours for ever,</hi> there is nothing in me, or that I can do but is at your commandment.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They call upon one another for further fellowſhip and communion. There is a call of the Father's upon vocation,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.44.</note> which is called <hi>drawing, vocatio alta &amp; ſecreta, a ſecret and deep vocation, Auſtin.</hi> And there is a calling unto communion, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>The Spirit ſaith, Come, and the Bride, Come.</hi> Now as in witneſſing, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7, 8. <hi>For there are three that bear record in heaven,</hi> &amp;c. they do all give a teſtimony, but it is done by the Spirit, in the Name of the Father,<note place="margin">Joh. 16.13.</note> Son, and Spirit; for Chriſt ſays, <hi>He ſhall take of mine, and give it unto you;</hi> ſo he doth in calling alſo, he doth ſpeak ſometimes in the Fathers name, and ſometimes in the Sons name; <hi>Open unto me, come away my beloved,</hi> &amp;c. and the ſoul always ſaith, <hi>Come;</hi> and therefore draws near unto God continually, and all is but to ſee the face of God, and that he may have ſome fellowſhip with him, who is the God of his life: God is his centre, and there is a tendency of ſoul to God; for godlineſs is nothing elſe but <hi>tendentia animae in Deum, the tendency of the ſoul to God,</hi> there is ſomething in the heart that doth echo unto God again; when he calls a ſoul to communion to ſeek his face, the ſoul anſwers, <hi>Thy face, Lord, will I ſeek.</hi> But it may be objected, <hi>How can it be, ſeeing God is in Heaven, that we ſhould ſee him, and have ſuch intimate fellowſhip here below?</hi> (1) God hath ſaid, <hi>I will dwell with you,</hi> the heart is the habitation of the great King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth;<note place="margin">Joh. 14.23.</note> 
                     <hi>he hath ſaid he will come to you, and dwell with you, and ſup with you.</hi> (2) There is a Spirit alſo that will carry your ſouls up to him again, as the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> was carried in the viſions of God to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 1.10.</note> and <hi>John was in the Spirit on the Lords day,</hi> &amp;c. though the body be upon Earth, the ſoul may be in Heaven with the Lord, and there all the Saints long to be, all their delight is in the mean while in the intercourſe that paſſes between God and their ſouls by ſweet fellowſhip and communion here.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The Arguments to ſtir you up thereunto are theſe.</hi> (1) Conſider this is the great end of the Covenant of Grace: it is not only <hi>peace,</hi> but <hi>good will,</hi> it is a Covenant of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the end of friendſhip is fellowſhip; and our end ſhould not fall below Gods end. (2) See the great preparation that the Lord hath made thereunto: all that Chriſt is ſaid in Scripture to have done, is but to give us acceſs unto God, and all that he hath ſuffered, it is all but <hi>to bring us to God,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.21. <hi>And we have acceſs by him to the throne of grace, Eph.</hi> 3.12. and it is the great end of all the workings of the Spirit alſo to bring us to God, and ſtrengthen us with might; for through him we have an acceſs by one Spirit to the Father.<note place="margin">Prov. 5.18.</note> (3) There is a ſweetneſs in fellowſhip; as 'tis ſaid of the wife, <hi>Let her be to thee as the young Hind and pleaſant Roe, let her breaſts ſatisfie thee at all times, and be thou raviſhed always with her love:</hi> and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Thou waſt very pleaſant to me, thy love to me was wonderful,</hi> &amp;c. and yet there are no men but have burdenſom diſpoſitions, which they diſcover ſometimes more than at others; but who would not walk with the great God, who is Love, and Holineſs, and Wiſdom in perfection, whoſe paths are all pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and whoſe ways are peace?

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>What is meant by the Alſufficience of God, or why is God called Alſufficient?</hi> A perfect good is an alſufficient good.<note place="margin">Ariſt. Ethic. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>7.</hi>
                     </note> Now that is a perfect good which ſupplies all a mans wants, and does ſatisfie all his deſires, both in this life, and in the life to come; which only can do it, if enjoyed alone, and without which nothing elſe can, if a man had all the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Heaven and of Earth. 1. There is in God enough to ſupply all a mans wants: a man cannot ſtand in need of that bleſſing that is not to be found in the bleſſed God, and that is not only <hi>efficiently,</hi> as all good things come from him, but <hi>formally,</hi> as all good things are in him; for he doth make uſe of the ſupport of the creatures, as he doth of all their operations, not to ſupply any defect that is in himſelf, and therefore ſometimes he will make uſe of their aſſiſtance, and ſometimes he will do it without them, to ſhew that they are but inſtruments, and <hi>operantur ac ſi non operarentur,</hi> and this will appear, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. <hi>The Lord God is a Sun,</hi> there is a double notion of a Sun in Scripture: (1) <hi>Ob ſplendorem, foelicitatem ſignificat.</hi> (2) <hi>Ob aeſtum infoelicitatem, by reaſon of its ſplendour it notes felicity, and by reaſon of its ſcorching,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 60.19, 20. Rev. 21.23.</note> 
                     <hi>infelicity: thy Sun ſhall no more go down, for the Lord ſhall be thine everlaſting light: the city ſhall have no need of the light of the Sun, for the glory of God ſhall enlighten it.</hi> It is not ſpoken (as ſome would wreſt it) of the Scripture and Ordinances, but it is of all temporal proſperity and felicity, they ſhall have ſuch a ſupply from God immediately, that though they ſhall have abundance, ſuch as never was in the world, yet they ſhall have no need of it, by reaſon of the immediate ſupply that they ſhall have from God himſelf:<note place="margin">Amos 8.9.</note> and ſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.9. <hi>Thy Sun ſhall ſet while it is yet day; I will cauſe thy Sun to ſet at noon day,</hi> that is, all thy comforts and thy proſperity ſhall ſuddenly and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly depart, when you looked for nothing leſs: ſo that by the Sun is meant all happineſs, all comfort, all proſperity; and there needs but one Sun, and when this Sun doth ſhine, there will be no need of the light of the Moon, or the Stars, and he that having God, doth take in any other comfort, it's but <hi>Lucernam ad Solem accendere, ſetting up a candle when the Sun doth ſhine:</hi> there is enough in him, there needs no more. And this will appear firſt in this life, and that by theſe three demonſtrations. (1) He that hath God, has all things elſe:<note place="margin">Rev. 21.7.</note> 
                     <hi>He that overcomes ſhall inherit all things, I will be his God;</hi> and it was all the portion that Chriſt looked for and gloried in,<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.5.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup, the lines are fallen to me in a pleaſant place,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.30. <hi>He ſhall have an hundred-fold more in this preſent time;</hi> it cannot be in kind, and therefore cannot be underſtood <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,</hi> but <hi>eminently,</hi> that is, he ſhall have in God the comforts of all theſe, if they were an hundred times, nay if they were a thouſand times multiplied. (2) It will further appear by this, if there were not an alſufficiency in God, he could never give a ſelf-ſufficiency un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Saints; for they have no ſufficiency in themſelves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>We are not ſufficient of our ſelves, as of our ſelves;</hi> we have a ſufficiency, but it's not in our ſelves, as of our ſelves, but it is that which we receive by grace, and is by God communicated unto us; but a godly man hath a ſelf-ſufficiency,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Godlineſs is great gain, I know how to want, and how to abound, I am inſtructed in all things;</hi> yet this is not to be underſtood of ſelf as divided from God, but of ſelf as united to God, he hath his ſufficiency in him alone: now he that can give a man a ſelf-ſufficience, muſt have in him an alſufficience. (3) It will appear, if we conſider the particulars, whatever a man can in this life ſtand in need of, it is all to be had in God, in ſuch a way as a man ſhall not need to go any whither elſe for a ſupply, but unto him alone.</p>

The only proper ground of a mans perfection with God is laid up in this alſufficiency of God, that a man needs not go out unto any thing elſe, he needs do ſervice to no other, and they that do ſo, do proclaim that they look not unto him as alſufficient; but when the ſoul is ſatisfied in this, that he has God, and can ſay, In that I have enough, then will he be perfect with him alone: ſo it was with <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Lord would ſend him unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> but <hi>Moſes</hi> tells him,<note place="margin">Exod. 4.11.</note>

As when men depart from the rule of the word, they multiply inventions, and ſo make up a patched Religion: ſo when men depart from God, they do heap up creatures that make up a patched felicity: and it is this is the great and continual fear of the Saints; and therefore a great part of filial fear lies in this, and is a main difference between that and ſervile fear, which is well expreſſed by <hi>Auſtin, Haec ne veniat, illa ne diſcedat; haec ne puniat, illa ne deſerat:</hi> and therefore he doth endeavour to keep up the thoughts of Gods alſufficiency as his portion from day to day.</p>

For them that ſet their hearts upon the ſufficiency of the creatures, and having the creatures in abundance, they think that there is a ſufficiency in them, and when they want the creatures, they look upon themſelves as being defective in point of ſufficiency. I confeſs there is a curſe come upon all the creatures, that they are become a ſnare to us; that which was made to be a ſervant, has with <hi>Reuben</hi> climbed up into his fathers bed, and ever ſince Satan has been the god of this world, which he never was until man ſold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto Satan, and ſince man ſubjected himſelf to the evil one.

(1) If there be any real good in any creature, it is derived unto it from God: they are all cyphers, and they have no good in them of themſelves, but what is put into them; if God will put much of his Spirit into a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, as he did into <hi>Moſes,</hi> the abilities of many men ſhall be in that one man, he ſhall rule his people with great ſucceſs; and if the Lord will afterward take it away, and divide it amongſt men, it is as he will diſpoſe of it, whether to fill the veſſel, or empty it: and if the Lord will create the fruit of the lips peace, a Miniſter ſhall be able to ſpeak peace, and adminiſter a word that ſhall be in ſeaſon unto him that is weary; but elſe though he ſpeak with never ſo much eloquence, it will be to no purpoſe, there is no more in it than God puts into it. (2) There is appearing good, and that is put into the creatures by the ſubtilty of Satan and by the luſts of men. [1] By the ſubtilty of Satan; for he intending to make uſe of the creature to betray the ſoul of a man, doth put a fair gloſs upon it and a varniſh, as we ſee he did to Chriſt, when he repreſented to him the Kingdoms of the world and the glory of them in a moment of time; ſo doth Satan repreſent the creatures to us in his own glaſs, and deceives us with the apparent good that is in them. [2] There is alſo ſomething that the luſts of men do add, and that is a conceit, that there is ſome ſuch excellency in it;<note place="margin">Prov. 18.11.</note> it is a ſtrong hold and a high wall, it's deſirable for food, and pleaſant to the taſte, but it is but in his own conceit, and all the pomp of the world is but fancy, and all the great things of the world are not great in reality, but only that great affection and the high apprehenſion that men have of them, makes them ſeem ſo to be,<note place="margin">Pſal. 36.9.</note> but with God only is the <hi>fountain of life:</hi> by life is meant all good, and it is in God ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, as in a fountain; it is in the creatures but derivatively, as in a ſtream; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's the greateſt folly for a man to leave the fountain to go to the ſtreams, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Sun to take our light from the Moon and the Stars, which ſhine only by a borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed light; and upon this ground the Saints are not much troubled at the miſcarriages in creatures, when they promiſe fair, but by and by their hopes are nipt, and it brings not the work to perfection; therefore they regard it not, and ſay it is but a bucket broken, and a ſtream dried up, a pipe ſtopped, but there is as much water in the fountain ſtill as ever, and unto that he has immediate recourſe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. A man's retiring unto creatures in any of his ſtraits is that which doth cauſe God to leave him; for no man is to have a double dependence, becauſe that argues a double heart; God will be all in all for ſupports and ſupplies, as well as Chriſt will be all in all for righteouſneſs and ſalvation;<note place="margin">2 Chron. 26.15.</note> and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>That <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah was helped till he was ſtrong,</hi> he was marvellouſly helped, but then his heart withdrew from God unto his own ſupports, and then the Lord left him to them, which proved his overthrow; <hi>for with him only the fatherleſs find mercy,</hi> they that are truly ſo in their own eſteem and account, and have none to look to, or make proviſion for them any more than fatherleſs children have, it is in him that they ſhall find mercy; but they that ſay unto the creatures, Thou art my father, and they have their help in them, there is no mercy for them in the Lord in an evil day, the creature then ſhall be ſo far from aſſiſting, that it ſhall diſtreſs them; for the Lord rejects carnal confidence,<note place="margin">2 Kings 16.5, 8.

(2) There is alſo a ſufficiency in reſpect of grace received, as we ſee in <hi>Peter, Though all men forſake thee, yet will not I,</hi> though I ſhould die with thee, yet will not I deny thee; having received a principle of grace, he looked upon the acting of it in his own power, as if he had no more dependence upon Chriſt the Fountain of his grace, but could go out in his own ſtrength againſt the temptation, and this makes men truſt in themſelves; for all ſelf-confidence depends and is grounded upon a ſelf-ſufficiency, and this the Apoſtle denies to be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. <hi>We are not ſufficient of our ſelves, to think any thing as of our ſelves, all our ſufficiency is of God:</hi> for pride being an inordinate and high apprehenſion of a mans own excellency; therefore the higher the excellency, the greater is the pride, and the more will Satan ſurely put a man upon a dependence thereupon, that he that is able to do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens him, and by the power of God, ſhall look upon himſelf as the fountain of his own ſufficiency; which was properly the Devils ſin, and it is the like Godhead that he ſtrives to affect men withal, that whereas the proper end of grace is to carry a man out of himſelf, and to make him happy in another, and ſo ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in another, Satan perſwades a man, that having received grace he ſhould place this in himſelf, and in the grace that he has received, which is properly a Torch from Hell, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. which may and many times doth befal the heirs of Heaven, that they that place truly their happineſs in God, yet may too far ſeek a ſufficiency in themſelves, and too much omit faſtning upon the Lord Jeſus, who is our <hi>Saviour to the uttermoſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

[2] Some put this difference, that the Spirit to ſome gives gifts as a <hi>Spirit aſſiſting</hi> only, but not <hi>dwelling</hi> there where he aſſiſts by gifts; but where grace is, there is a <hi>reſidence of the Spirit,</hi> and that not only according unto the gifts and effects, as in the other, but according to the eſſence; for we are ſaid to be Temples of the Holy Ghoſt.

So when the Prophets had received a Spirit of Prophecy, and the Apoſtles a gift of Miracles, yet notwithſtanding they could not act it when they would, but when the Spirit of the Lord came upon them, as it was with <hi>Samſon;</hi> and therefore it's a kind of a Proverb that <hi>Luther</hi> has in <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Spiritus Sanctus non ſemper tangit cor Prophetarum, The Spirit doth not always touch the Prophets heart:</hi> ſo the Apoſtles had a gift of healing, but they could not heal when they would; and therefore when <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus</hi> had been ſick, and was nigh death alſo, <hi>Paul</hi> who had the gift of healing (for when they brought from him but handkerchiefs and aprons, the diſeaſes departed from them) yet he cannot now heal him who was ſo dear to him, and whoſe miniſtery was ſo uſeful: it's not in a mans power therefore to act his own gifts, he cannot uſe his own abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities at his own pleaſure: as there is an ability in a man to gather and know much of God by his works that are in the world, yet it is according as God did point and direct his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or elſe he could never do it: <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19. it is manifeſt in the creation of the world, for God has ſhewed it unto them; and to know what ſeed to ſow, and with what inſtruments to threſh, and when the ground is fit for ſeed, and when it is ſufficiently plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is <hi>God that doth inſtruct him to diſcretion,</hi> Eſa. 28.26. <hi>The men of might cannot find their hands;</hi> they were men of ſtrength, and they were skilful in war, but they could not uſe it at ſuch a time, they could not find their hands, it is unto them as if they had no ſtrength, as if they had had no skill, for they have no uſe of them: therefore remember this when you place your ſufficiency ſo much in theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5) As they that have theſe gifts cannot act them of themſelves without Gods aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſo neither can they give ſucceſs to them, or make them in any meaſure effectual: the beſt men have but their meaſure, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.4. God has not given all gifts to one man, and therefore the greateſt and the beſt and moſt eminent member of the body ſhall have need of the gifts of the meaneſt; there is a ſupply of every joynt unto the edifying of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, there is ſomething in the meaneſt Saint that thou maiſt deſpiſe as weak-gifted, yet it is wanting in thee, and thou canſt not give ſucceſs to thy greateſt endeavours, but he that gives the gift muſt give the bleſſing: <hi>mundus non poteſt eſſe ſine perſonarum diſcrimine,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="6">(6) When we place our ſufficiency in them, that will provoke the Lord to take them away from us; there are two things that provoke God exceedingly, one is being weary of our work, as it was in <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the other is when we do exalt our ſelves in our work, and put an excellency upon our ſelves for our own actings; therefore ſays the Lord, <hi>From him that hath not ſhall be taken away,</hi> he will put thee out of thy ſtewardſhip, if thou waſte his goods to maintain thy own pride; and there is nothing in the world doth blaſt the parts of men more, and provoke God to take them away in judgment, and the man dies beſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he withers in all the greenneſs that did appear ſo freſh in him;<note place="margin">Joh. 15.6.</note> he doth in this (ſaith <hi>Luther</hi>) as <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> when he ſaw there was no way to take men off from ſeeking wealth,<note place="margin">In Gen. 4.4.</note>

                  <p n="2">2. When men do place not only ſufficiency in their gifts, but in grace received, which a man alſo is very apt to do; and let me tell you, it is the higheſt ſpiritual pride in the world, and is an abuſe of the higheſt gift and grace of God. (1) Conſider it is quite contrary to the nature of grace, which is to live in another, and to fetch all from another, and therefore it is an unnatural ſin.

(2) There is a double ſufficiency: [1] Not receiving an addition of good; ſo God only is ſufficient. [2] As containing all things neceſſary; and ſo there is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in grace, for it brings all things into the ſoul, and fills it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is a great proneneſs in the beſt men unto this great evil, that having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved grace, they place their ſufficiency in it, and that for matter of ſtrength and matter of comfort. (1) As to matter of ſtrength, a man that has received grace is apt to think, that he being made alive from the dead, is able now to perform thoſe vital actions that flow from this life; ſurely now I can hear, I can pray, and can perform the duties of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs as becomes a living man; or if by the power of ſin and the ſtrength of temptation the outward act be hindred and interrupted, yet they cannot hinder the inward workings of the Spirit; and as I am able to do that which is good, ſo I ſhall be able to reſiſt that which is evil: ſo that as grace is in me a well of water ſpringing up to everlaſting life in the duties of holineſs; ſo alſo it will of it ſelf work out the mud of corruption that Satan and the old man doth caſt into it from day to day: and we ſee this in <hi>Peter,</hi> he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a principle of grace, and his heart was warmed with a true fire, the principle of the love of Chriſt, whom he loved ſo greatly, that he thought it impoſſible that he ſhould ſo far forget it as to deny him, and therefore he ſpeaks for himſelf after the reſolution or preſumption of his heart; Whatſoever other men do, yet though I ſhould ſtand by him alone, come what will come, I will confeſs him in the face of danger, I will never deny him; and ſo many a man doth by the ſtrength of grace received promiſe himſelf ſecurity from ſome ſins, and therefore they are ſecure in themſelves, and exceeding cenſorious of others. It is true, men will ſay, I cannot reſiſt rovings of heart, and vain deſires, and ſinful love, and carnal fear, and inordinate paſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but for drunkenneſs and adultery, murder, perſecution of the Saints, or Apoſtaſie from Religion, and the Truths of God, I hope I am ſecure from theſe; and the man walks not in fear of them: and it's very common for young and weak Chriſtians ſo to do, and they are exceeding bitter and cenſorious againſt other men, and they immediately queſtion their eſtates, whom they ſee do fall into theſe ſins, which they ignorantly conceive, that the very being of grace ſecures them from. And ſo it is in reſpect of duties, having received grace, he doth conceive, that he can pray, and hear, and perform the duties of Gods worſhip in another manner than a natural man can, for he has received a new principle, and therefore having done a duty at one time, having truſted God, or ſhewed forth an act of love to God, he thinks he can do the ſame at another time; and by this means a man is the leſs ſolicitous for an immediate ſupply for the diſcharge of ſuch duties as he is to perform; he thinks that he has received a ſtock ſufficient to defray the charge: It is true, ſays he, if I am put upon a greater tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or upon the performance of any higher duties, then I ſhall ſee reaſon to go unto Chriſt for a ſupply; but as for theſe ordinary things in both kinds, the grace that I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy received is ſufficient for it, according unto that ordinary and natural way of concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of God with his own grace, which doubtleſs he will delight in, as he doth concur with the creatures in the common actions of their lives; and ſo a mans ſufficiency in point of ſtrength is much in reference unto the ſtrength of grace that he has received, either to perform duties, or to reſiſt ſin. And (2) as it is for matter of ſtrength, ſo it is for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of comfort alſo, having received grace from God, men turn in upon themſelves, and by a reflection upon their own graces they think to raiſe their ſpirits under any deſertion or dejection whatſoever; and therefore when they walk in the dark at any time, they are immediately poring upon their own graces, to ſee what witneſs their own ſpirits will give unto them, and by the evidence of their own hearts they conceive, that they can comfort themſelves at any time, when they are in a doubt in the matter of their eſtates towards God. <hi>Principale ſpeculum ad videndum Deum eſt animus rationalis inveniens ſeipſum: hoc ſpeculum verus poenitens non ceſſat quotidie inſpicere,</hi> Bernard. de inter.

There is a great policy of Satan therein: if it were in the power of the Devil man ſhould never receive any good from God; for he that envied the good eſtate of man at firſt in which he was created, touched him with the ſame devilliſhneſs that was in himſelf, and thereby became <hi>a murderer from the beginning;</hi> for he left no good in the man, In me,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> that is, in my fleſh there dwells no good thing; and he doth as truly deſire and endeavour from the ſame principle of envy to keep out all good, as at firſt he did to caſt it out; but if the Lord will ſow wheat, and the envious man cannot prevent the ſeed-time, then he will take the opportunity to ſow tares alſo with the wheat, that he ſhall diſhonour God with the grace that he has received from him, and with it ſacrifice unto himſelf, who is under Satan the great Idol, and by honouring himſelf he doth ſacrifice unto Satan all the while; and ſo a man placing his ſufficiency in grace received, even grace it ſelf, if it were poſſible, ſhould tend unto his deſtruction, that was a ſpecial grace, and with ſpecial and eternal love was given for his ſalvation; for Satan looks upon grace in the Saints as being the image of God, and as his greateſt enemy, and that which he hates more than he does the ſouls of men, or any thing in the world; for his main malice is at godly men only, becauſe they bear Gods image; for his hatred is <hi>directly</hi> againſt God, it is unto us but <hi>collaterally,</hi> and in the ſecond place; as the Saints love God, and they love grace for Gods ſake, ſo the Devil directly hates God, and he hates grace as being that by which God is moſt honoured; therefore his greateſt deſigns are to pervert grace in the Saints, he will keep men as long as he can to ſtand out againſt grace, and reſiſt it as long as he can, that the ſtrong man armed may keep the houſe; but if he cannot keep grace out of the heart, then his next deſign is to advance grace above a creature, and ſet it in the place of God and Chriſt, and make grace it ſelf to be an Idol, and the man to place his ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in it, and his dependence upon it; and he knows that God is engaged againſt the habits of grace in the man, though they be the works of his own Spirit, the Apoſtle ſaith that there is <gap reason="foreign">

Thus as the Lord works by contraries bringing light out of darkneſs, and the greateſt good ſometimes out of the greateſt evil; ſo doth Satan alſo work by contraries, and delights to do it, to bring darkneſs out of light, and to bring the greateſt evil out of that which is the greateſt good, even grace it ſelf, for <hi>quò quis ſanctior, eò pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, the better the worſe,</hi> if he place his ſufficience and dependence upon the grace he has received; for that is <hi>Idolum ſpecioſiſſimum, the moſt ſpecious evil.</hi> Now that I may take the Saints off from a dependence upon their own graces, and that their ſufficiency may be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in God alone, conſider theſe particulars. 1. Though grace be the beſt of all the creatures, and the image of God, and a new Creation wrought by the Spirit of Chriſt, which the Lord takes more delight in than he doth in all the creatures, and without which he can take no pleaſure in any of them; yet grace is but a creature, and therefore the common nature of a creature doth belong to it, and that is to be defectible and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in its own nature to decay. It's true,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.24. Col. 3.10.</note> that it is the ſame image that is renewed in us, which we loſt in <hi>Adam.</hi> Now as the image in <hi>Adam</hi> was ſubject to decay, ſo in its own nature this is alſo. As it is with the Angels, though they be confirmed in grace, and can never fall away (ſo it is with the ſouls of juſt men made perfect) yet being creatures, there is a defectibility in them, a <hi>poſſible folly,</hi> though not <hi>actual,</hi>

And therefore ſome very learned men have maintained, <hi>That there are no habits of grace in us at all, but that we live by an immediate influence from the Spirit of Chriſt, which dwelling in us, doth act our ſpirits ſometimes in a way of faith, ſometimes in a way of love, ſometimes in a way of godly ſorrow,</hi> &amp;c. which I cannot conſent to, as being an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme on the other hand; we are ſaid to be new creatures, and created in Chriſt, and we are ſaid to have faith and hope as fruits of the Spirit dwelling in us; and therefore we are exhorted to ſtir them up, and to act them, and to grow in them; and they are ſaid to decay in us, and to increaſe in us, which cannot be in reſpect of acts meerly by the Spirit of God working upon us, but we have truly a life within us, that is, an inward principle that puts forth vital actions,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> but yet it is a life that is maintained by union; and therefore though <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I live,</hi> yet he looks off from himſelf immediately upon the fountain of his life, and the manner of the conveyance of it, and that is by union conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually;<note place="margin">Phil. 1.19.</note> and therefore <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.19. we read of <hi>a ſupply of the Spirit,</hi>

(1) That the Spirit is not communicated unto the Saints as a Spirit of Grace all at once, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and this in a ſecret and an unobſerved way. (2) That the Spirit hath undertaken this work as a publick office and adminiſtration in the Church of Chriſt. (3) That the ſupplies of the Spirit come in by the teaching of the Spirit. (4) That the Spirits ſupplies are rich and abundant ſupplies in all things neceſſary unto the ſalvation of the Saints. Now the more any ſin is againſt nature, as we ſay murder is, and unthankfulneſs is, and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to parents is, the more hateful it is, and there is a principle in nature that is againſt all ſuch ſins in a ſpecial manner: and ſo is this alſo an unnatural ſin, for grace to be ſet up in a man by God the Author of it, and yet for a man to deal ſo unnaturally with God, as to make the grace he hath received from him his own ſufficiency, and neglect the God who alone is alſufficient.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. No man is able to act the grace that he hath received. Chriſt tells his Diſciples plainly,<note place="margin">Joh. 15.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Without me you can do nothing;</hi> not only by virtue of our union with Chriſt is our grace acted, but there muſt be a daily and a continual influence from Chriſt alſo, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. and the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>We are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God,</hi> &amp;c. As there is an immediate dependence of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures upon the firſt cauſe, ſo there is of grace alſo upon its firſt cauſe: now <hi>Deus agit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatè cum omni agente creato, God acts immediately in all;</hi> ſo it's here alſo, and if the Lord will ſuſpend but his own actings, no creature can act or do any thing; as we ſee it in the fiery Furnace, in which the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> put the three Children, the fire remained true fire ſtill, for it immediately conſumed the men that were thrown in, but yet the Lord ſuſpended the <hi>actum ſecundum, the ſecond act</hi> of the creature, and it could not burn the three Children: as it is in the creature, ſo it is in grace much more; but the one is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and the other is a ſupernatural concurrence, and therefore hath a more ſpecial and ſupernatural dependence and influence: now the Spirit is a free Agent, he works where, and when, and in what manner he pleaſeth, ſometimes God doth as it were withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from us, and then all our grace is becalmed, for it is as wind to the ſails, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we read of <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="369" facs="tcp:52030:205"/> of the ſails; for the Spirit of God is compared to wind; when he will fill the ſail, a man is carried on with a full gale, or elſe he cannot move, he can but lye in the harbour, ſo that though the man hath grace, yet he can never be able to perform one good duty, either inward or outward, without further aſſiſtance. It is true, that the Lord doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly concur with grace, according to the meaſure given to the ſoul, as he doth with the reſt of the creatures according to their kind; but yet the Lord will ſometimes withdraw to let them ſee where their ſtrength lyes, and where the fountain of all their grace is, he will uſe his Prerogative, and leave a ſoul to it ſelf, and then reſolve a Chriſtian into his principles; and one would think, having ſuch a good foundation laid, ſuch a ſtock laid in a man, he can think well, or ſpeak well, or do well when he pleaſes, and he may begin to rouze up himſelf as at other times, as <hi>Samſon</hi> did, no, he hath not ſo much as a ſufficiency to think a good thought, all the grace that he hath cannot procure it to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. All the grace that a man hath cannot free him from temptations, nor ſecure him from falling into the greateſt and the fouleſt evil that a godly man is capable of. (1) It preſerves a man from no temptation; grace could not preſerve <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, or Chriſt himſelf from being tempted, whoſe grace was perfect:<note place="margin">Proſper.</note> 
                     <hi>Viatoris gratia neminem intentabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem facit, The grace of a viator makes no man intentable;</hi> and therefore we ſee what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous temptations the Saints have had; Satan ſtood againſt <hi>David,</hi> as he did againſt <hi>Joſhua, Zac.</hi> 3. but it was againſt the one for temptation, and the other for accuſation, and grace could preſerve from neither. (2) It cannot preſerve a man from the greateſt and the fouleſt falls; as we ſee how <hi>David</hi> fell into <hi>adultery,</hi> and <hi>murder,</hi> and <hi>numbering the people;</hi> and <hi>Samſon</hi> alſo to the ſame ſin of uncleanneſs again and again; and <hi>Peter</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied his Maſter, and began to curſe and to ſwear, that he never knew him, he wiſht upon himſelf the moſt terrible and dreadful curſes, if he knew the man. There are only two ſins that a godly man is ſecure from by the ſtate of grace, and that is, the <hi>ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and <hi>final impenitency;</hi> but it is not the grace that is in a man that doth ſecure him from falling into ſin, but the ſtate of grace by reaſon of his Head Chriſt Jeſus, to whom he is united, and by reaſon of the Covenant under which he ſtands; therefore there is no ſufficiency in that grace that will not preſerve a man from the greateſt ſins and fouleſt falls; and indeed how is it poſſible that it ſhould preſerve us, that cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it ſelf? as <hi>Auſtin</hi> did deride and mock the gods of the Heathen, <hi>They that cannot keep themſelves but are ſtoln away, much leſs could they keep others;</hi> ſo it is of grace alſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. This will certainly provoke God againſt thy grace; though it be his own work, yet he will let it decay, as he doth his own Ordinances of the Law, which are called <hi>beggerly rudiments,</hi> and <hi>Nehuſhtan, a little piece of braſs:</hi> God will abaſe the excellency of all creatures that we make an Idol of, and the Lord will let you ſee, that your grace can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not preſerve you: and therefore there are two reaſons why God hath let the Saints fall, and hath ſet before you their example.

(1) They have their portion here, they have received their conſolation, it is all that ever they are like to have from the Lord: as when you ſee a young man have a portion of money left him, and he flaunts it out, and is in all his glory, you ſay it will be ſpent, and he hath no yearly income, this is all, it hath no root that it may grow again, as all the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Saints have.

                  <p n="2">2. It enables a man for all the works he hath to do in the world: the Lord ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> in a great ſervice to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and he tells him, <hi>I will be with thee;</hi> and when <hi>Moſes</hi> did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject he had a <hi>ſtammering tongue,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>I will be with thy tongue;</hi> and the alſufficiency of God was his ſufficiency for his work: ſo he ſends <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and tells him, <hi>He will never leave him nor forſake him,</hi> and nothing ſhall be able to ſtand before him all his days: and ſo the Apoſtles were ſent forth as <hi>ſheep,</hi> &amp;c. but he bids them, <hi>Go, for behold I am with you unto the end of the world.</hi> A man needs nothing elſe to enable him for any ſervice but this, <hi>God is alſufficient for me;</hi> and were it not for that, there are many of Gods people would ſink under the apprehenſion of their own weakneſſes, and the burdenſom callings that lye upon them from day to day: <hi>Chriſtus tunc regnat in nobis, quando nos ab operibus noſtris feria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos inhabitat, cùm ipſè in nobis facit opera noſtra,</hi> Luther. <hi>Chriſt then reigns in us, when he works in us,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo a mans ſoul keeps a Sabbath unto Chriſt: as in point of Juſtification a man ſaith, My good works are the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; ſo in point of ability a man ſaith, My ability is his alſufficiency; for I am of my ſelf able to do nothing; and therefore when a Saint looks upon himſelf and the greatneſs of the ſervice that he is called to, he ſays, <hi>Who is ſufficient?</hi> who can do any thing of this great work? but when he looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the alſufficiency of God for his ſupply, then he ſaith, Who is inſufficient? <hi>I can do all things,</hi> and the greater the ſervice is that any man is called unto, and the greater difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he encounters with, the more he is to take hold of the alſufficiency of God.</p>

(3) The tryal of gold is but for this life, <hi>ad exiguum tempus eſt utilis,</hi> for it is gold that periſheth; but the tryal of faith refers to the life to come, for by faith a man lays hold of eternal life, and the purer the faith is, the ſurer the hold is. (4) The tryal of gold makes it the more precious unto men, we eſteem tryed gold above other; and therefore the moſt precious gold is ſet forth by it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18. ſo it is with tryed faith, it makes it the more precious unto God, and therefore he doth try it, <hi>ut coram ipſo gratior fiat;</hi> tryed faith is more precious in Gods eyes, as tryed gold is to ours, as the word of the Lord is a tryed word; though the people of God do prize the whole word of God, that it is dearer to them than thouſands of gold and ſilver, yet there is no part of the word that hath ſo high a price with them as a tryed word; as the word of faith, the more it's tryed, is the more precious with us, ſo the grace of faith, the more it's tryed, it is the more precious with God; and if the tryal of faith be ſo precious, what is the tryal of a mans intereſt, which is that unto which the tryal of all graces tends? for the witneſs of water, as well as of blood, is, that we may know whether we have eternal life abiding in us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

And the word in the Hebrew doth ſignifie three things in the Scripture: (1) <hi>Inclinavit,</hi> for the bent of a mans heart to go out that way, as <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.3. where there were two that contended for the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, it's ſaid, <hi>That their hearts inclined after Abimeleck,</hi> 1 King. 2.28. <hi>Joab inclined after Adonijah,</hi> though he turned not after <hi>Abſolom:</hi> a mans heart muſt go out in the bent of it this way. (2) <hi>Reclinavit,</hi> for a man to reſt upon a thing, <hi>Amos</hi> 2.8. <hi>You lye down upon cloaths laid to pledge,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore the word ſignifies <hi>lectum,</hi> a bed upon which men lye down, or reſt themſelves: and ſo it ſhould be here, the ſoul ſhould reſt and lean upon this alſufficiency of God as that which he hath choſen, and in which he reſts; and therefore the word ſignifies <hi>baculum,</hi> a ſtaff to lean upon.

For there is a double putting forth of every Attribute of God ſavingly upon his Elect; not only a putting of it forth in his works and adminiſtrations towards them, but there is alſo a putting of it forth by exalting it in a man; and therein the main ſweetneſs of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of it doth lye. He therefore that hath not had the price of this Attribute raiſed in his ſoul, nor taſted the ſweetneſs of it, nor rejoyced in it, nor adored and admired it, and God as ſuch a one, under the apprehenſion of ſuch an attribute, truly that man hath no intereſt in it. If a Saint cannot ſay that attribute is mine, and this attribute I have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in, yet he can admire the attribute, and give God the glory of it as an excellency in himſelf; and he doth not only praiſe God for his goodneſs towards him, but as it is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for the glorious excellencies that are in the Divine nature; as we may ſee it in <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.1, 2. <hi>My heart rejoyceth in the Lord, and my horn is exalted in the Lord; my mouth is enlarged over my enemies, I will rejoyce in thy ſalvation; there is none holy as the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. And as it is exceeding ſweet unto the people of God, and a Paradiſe to walk from one Tree to another in the Paradiſe of God, and to ſay ſuch a truth the Lord fulfilled unto me, in ſuch a caſe, and in ſuch an extremity, and ſuch a promiſe, at ſuch a time; ſo much more for a man to be able to look over all the attributes of God, and to ſay ſuch a time the Lord did glorifie ſuch an attribute towards me, and ſuch a time ſuch a one; and to ſee all the attributes of God, as well as all the works of God to work together for a mans good, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in their proper places; as <hi>the ſtars in their courſes fought againſt Siſera,</hi> and the threatnings of God fight againſt wicked men, ſo to have the word of God, the works of God, and the attributes of God work for a man, is their happineſs and their joy.</p>

(2) There is a <hi>following of God,</hi> or a walking after him, <hi>Num.</hi> 14.24. it's called following of the Lamb, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies three things: [1] A walking by rule; for a man muſt go no where but where he ſees the footſteps of God before him.

(3) There is a walking <hi>before God,</hi> that is, with a conſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto his all-ſeeing eye, he ſees the eye of God always upon him, and he ſees that to be a holy eye, that no ſin can ſcape it, nothing can blind it, all things are naked and open before it, and he that doth obſerve it, it is unto this end, that he may judge it, that he may give unto every man according as his works ſhall be, and that's the meaning, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.21. <hi>I have ſinned againſt heaven and before thee:</hi> by Heaven the Learned do underſtand the preſence of God, who doth dwell in Heaven; and therefore <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.9. <hi>They do ſet their mouth againſt heaven,</hi>

[3] He doth give them what law he will, ſome have a law written in their nature, there are ordinances of the heavens; and ſome have a law given them upon their underſtandings from without. [4] He doth order all their actions, that there is not any thing they do but it is according to the rule and dominion that he hath over them; <hi>not a ſparrow falls to the ground without my Father;</hi> The lot is caſt into the lap, but the determination is from God: not the ſmalleſt or the meaneſt, ordinary, and caſual things but they are at his diſpoſe, all come under his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and are ſubjected unto his dominion.

Therefore amongſt the creatures there is no ſuch thing as an abſolute Monarchy, in which men ſhould rule by will; for men are to rule as men, that is, by reaſon and by love; <hi>an abſolute Monarchy is but abſolute Tyranny;</hi> there muſt be known rules, by which they muſt govern: but ſo doth not the Lord, there is none to preſcribe to him, for his will is the rule of goodneſs, <hi>non ideò voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, quia bonum, ſed ideò bonum, quia volitum, a thing is not therefore willed by God, becauſe good, but it's therefore good, becauſe willed;</hi> for there is nothing that is good antecedent to the will of God.

Now how doth Chriſt as Mediator govern? It is by the guidance of the Spirit, and this Spirit moves both the Angels and the wheels; it is not ſpoken of thoſe ſpiritual acts of the Holy Ghoſt upon the hearts of the Saints, but of the ordinary diſpenſations of Providence or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering all things here below, ſo as the ends of Chriſt may be attained. It is the Mediator therefore that doth govern all things, and the motions and impreſſions that are made both upon the Angels and the wheels, they are from the Spirit of the Mediator, who makes the Spirit to be the Viceroy in the providential as well as in the ſpiritual Kingdom, as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes the Mediator to be in them both: and as the Father doth not diveſt himſelf of power, but keeps the original of it in himſelf, that we may ſtill ſay to him, <hi>Thine is the kingdom;</hi> only he doth it by the Son, who doth exerciſe it; ſo it is true of the Spirit alſo, the Son hath the power, he governs all, he doth it immediately by the Spirit, the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate execution and adminiſtration of it is in the hand of the Spirit in the one Kingdom as well as in the other.</p>
                  <p n="7">(7) This will further appear by the ſeſſion of Chriſt at the right hand of the Father; for it doth import <hi>poteſtatis &amp; Majeſtatis plenitudinem, a plenitude of power and Majeſty.</hi> [1] The higheſt Majeſty and glory; for it is the higheſt degree of his exaltation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.1. therefore called <hi>the right hand of Majeſty in the heavens.</hi> [2] It is the higheſt Authority and Soveraignty; for ſitting at his right hand implies, that all things are put under his feet, as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> ſitting down upon his Throne, Angels and Powers being made ſubject unto him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.20, 22. all things put under his feet, which is the higheſt Soveraignty and the greateſt ſubjection that can be, for all to be his ſervants, his vaſſals; and therefore <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. when he is in heaven he is ſaid <hi>to have the keys of hell and of death;</hi> keys are an enſign of authority, and ſo are uſed in the Scripture, the keys of the kingdom of heaven are his, and the keys of death and hell are his, all authority in this world and the world to come; and therefore <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.17. immediately before his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he ſaith, <hi>All power is given to me both in heaven and in earth:</hi> it's true, that he had it given him from the Fall; and he did exerciſe it by virtue of the Covenant that was paſſed between him and the Father; for his Kingly Office and his Prieſtly Office in the efficacy of them began together, but yet he did not actually reign as Mediator, that is, as God-man, till in our nature he aſcended up on high, and ſate down in heaven with the Father upon his Throne; and though <hi>quoad poteſtatem judiviariam, according to his judiciary power,</hi> all things are now put under his feet, for the adminiſtration of all things are in his hand, yet <hi>quoad executionem actualem, as to actual execution,</hi> ſo it is not; there are many things that ſeem to oppoſe him, and to be enemies unto his government; therefore he muſt reign till he hath put all his enemies actually under his feet, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.15. ſo then he that ſits at the right hand of God rules the world; but Chriſt as God doth not ſit at the right hand of God, and as he is the ſecond perſon; therefore it is as he is Mediator that he ſits at Gods right hand, and ſo all judgment and authority are executed by him.</p>
                  <p n="8">(8) If this be made as the ground why all authority is in the hand of Chriſt, becauſe he is the Son of man, then he hath this authority over all things, not as he is the ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon only, but as he is Mediator, as he is God-man; but this is the reaſon and the ground of it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.17. <hi>He hath given him power to execute judgment, becauſe he is the Son of man;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 5.27.</note> which hath ſeveral interpretations given of it, all will prove the thing.

                     </gap> is rendred <hi>quatenus,</hi> and ſo it is by <hi>Beza,</hi> that is, he hath all power given unto him, and all judgment, not only as he is God, as he is the ſecond perſon, but as he is <hi>the Son of man, quatenus homo, &amp;c. non tantùm ſecundùm naturam divinam, ſed etiam humanam;</hi> and ſo <hi>Chemnit.</hi> doth from hence infer, <hi>humana natura in Chriſto aſſumpta eſt in communicationem gubernationis rerum omnium, praecipuè verò regno
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:52030:214" rendition="simple:additions"/> Deo in Eccleſia.</hi> [3] It is by many others interpreted by that place, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Becauſe he humbled himſelf, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, therefore God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name above every name, that to the name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow,</hi> &amp;c. that is, this is the reward that the Father hath given him for his obedience in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, taking upon him our nature, the form of a ſervant; therefore he is exalted unto the higheſt pitch of Majeſty and of Authority, to be next to God himſelf. Now which interpretation ſoever we take of theſe, it will appear, that this power is given unto him, not only as he is God, but as he is Mediator, and that the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of giving it unto him is as he is the <hi>Son of man,</hi> and not as he is God; for as he is God, he had an equal hand in the Soveraignty of all things, and an equal right to it with the Father and the Spirit, and ſo it could not be ſaid to be given to him; but it is given him as <hi>the Son of man,</hi> and as a reward of his obedience, becauſe he became the Son of man.</p>
                  <p>But to anſwer an Objection or two about this. 1. It is objected, It appears plainly by Scripture, and is by you granted, That there is a double Kingdom of Chriſt, the one belonging to him by nature, and the other given to him by the Father; the one proper only unto Chriſt the Mediator, the other common to the Father and the Spirit, as well as to the Son; the one to be exerciſed for ever, and the other but for a time; wherefore there are two diſtinct Kingdoms of Chriſt; why therefore may we not ſay, that <hi>as he is the ſecond Perſon he rules in the world, and as he is the Mediator he rules in the Church only?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I do confeſs there are two Kingdoms, and theſe are really diſtinguiſhed one from another; that Chriſt as God hath an eſſential Kingdom equal with the Father, and a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which he doth receive by donation from the Father as he is God-man; but I ſay, That the exerciſe and adminiſtration of both Kingdoms are now in the hand of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and ſhall be unto the time of the reſtitution of all things, for <hi>the Father judges no man, Joh.</hi> 5.22. that is, <hi>natura divina abſolutè ſine Mediatore; judicium, ſive totam admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrationem dedit Filio Mediatori incarnato, &amp;c.</hi> Chemnit. <hi>i. e. totius mundi imperium, &amp;c. The Divine nature hath committed all judgment to Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that the ſpiritual Kingdom is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by the Spirit in the ordinances of the Goſpel, and the providential Kingdom by the power of his Spirit working without ordinances, who orders and diſpoſes of all the creatures unto their ſeveral ends; but yet all this is by the hand of the Mediator, and he doth not ſimply as he is God rule in the providential Kingdom only; for <hi>all judgment is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him,</hi> [that is, the government of all things] <hi>as he is the Son of man;</hi> as he is the Son of man ſo he rules the Angels, and they act the wheels, and as he is the Son of man, ſo he is <hi>appointed Heir of all things,</hi> and as he is the Son of man, ſo <hi>all things are put under his feet,</hi> all ſheep and oxen, and the beaſts of the field, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore it's but a conceit to ſay, That Chriſt doth rule the world indeed as he is God, but he doth rule the Church as he is Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator; for it appears plainly, That both of them are acts of his Kingly Office as he is Mediator, as the judging of the world will be at the laſt day; and he tells us, that God gave him all this power for this end, <hi>That he might give eternal life unto as many as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had given him, Joh.</hi> 17.20. he doth rule all things in the world, ſo as he makes them ſerviceable unto ſpiritual ends; but it's done by him not ſimply as God, but as Mediator: and ſo much Mr. <hi>Gileſpy</hi> cannot but grant out of <hi>Calvin</hi> in <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod, <hi>pag.</hi> 203. that all things are put under the feet of Chriſt the Mediator, not only in reſpect of glory and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but in reſpect of his power and over-ruling providence, whereby he can diſpoſe of all things, ſo as they make moſt for his glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is all that I aſſert; and that the Mediator is not barely Gods ſervant in the ſpiritual Kingdom, but in the Kingdom of Providence alſo, is plain from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But Chriſt as Mediator is King, Prieſt, and Prophet, but he is not ſo any where but in his Church; therefore to ſay, that Chriſt as Mediator doth it, is as much as to ſay, he doth it as King, Prieſt, and Prophet; and ſo he ſhall be made a King, Prieſt, and Prophet unto the Pagans, and unto all other creatures, even to the Devils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's not neceſſary that whatever he doth as Mediator muſt flow from all his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; for he doth many things as he is King, that he doth not as he is a Prieſt, or a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: he is unto the Angels a King, and that as he is the Son of man; for he is the Head of all Principalities and Powers; and yet he is not unto the Angels a Prieſt; yet as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator he rules them, and they do belong unto his Kingdom as Mediator: and as he is King, ſo he ſhall judge the world alſo at the laſt day, ſo he ſhall judge the Heathen, he ſhall judge the Devils, and ſo he doth rule them now, and over-rule them for the good of the Church; and yet he is not unto the Heathen a Prieſt nor a Prophet, neither is he ſo unto the Devils: But his rule and dominion over the works of God is as truly part of his Kingdom, as his rule and dominion over the ſouls of the Saints; the Mediator is not a Prieſt and a Prophet to every thing to whom he is a King, and yet he is a King
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:52030:214" rendition="simple:additions"/> as Mediator, and ſo far as any thing relates unto his Kingly Office, ſo far it may be ſaid to belong unto him as Mediator, becauſe as Mediator he is King as well as Prieſt; he is indeed a Prieſt and a Prophet only to his people, but as he is a King ſo he rules over his enemies, even thoſe that will not acknowledge his kingdom over them. It's true, that none have an intereſt in any Office of Chriſt, but he that hath an intereſt in them all, and therefore he cannot be ſaid to be our King ſo as to rule us for our ſpiritual and eternal good, unleſs he be alſo our Prophet and our Prieſt; and none are in this ſenſe the Subjects of the Kingdom of Chriſt, but they that conſent to and accept of his government, they that kiſs the Son; but yet he is a King appointed by God, though he be not accepted by us, and therefore he is Gods King, that is, he rules by Gods commiſſion, and as a ſervant unto his ends, even then when we acknowledge him not to be our King, and his government is not aſſented to by us; he will judge them as a King, though he doth not ſave them as a King.</p>
                  <p n="3">§. 3. <hi>The government of all things in his Kingdom is exerciſed by him in the behalf of the Saints, and ſo they have a right to the Soveraignty of God, and it is made over to them,</hi> as will appear, 1. In this, that it was given to Chriſt for their ſake; he hath a kingdom given him not for his own ſake, but for our ſakes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2.<note place="margin">Joh. 17.2.</note> 
                     <hi>He hath given him power over all fleſh, that he might give eternal life unto as many as thou haſt given him, imperium accepit Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus, non tam ſibi, quàm noſtrae ſalutis cauſâ, Calv.</hi> ſo that it was with ſpecial reſpect unto them, that he did undertake the government of the world; had it not been that he had a people in the world that were given him of the Father, and whoſe names were written in the Lambs book, and whom he did intend to ſave, he would not have undertaken the government of all things; for <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22. he is made the <hi>head over all things,</hi> but it is to the Church, <hi>magna conſolatio eſt, quòd tantum imperium habet is, qui id exercet Eccleſiae bono, &amp;c. Grot.</hi> But wherein lies the force of this reaſon, that he muſt have power over all fleſh, that he might give eternal life unto as many as God had given him? Why could not Chriſt have given them eternal life unleſs he had had power over all fleſh, unleſs the government of the world had been put into his hands? I conceive the force of it to lye in this. 1. Had the government ſtill been in the hand of God as God, ſo he muſt have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded according to the rules of the firſt Covenant, and according to the ſeverity of a God; and therefore <hi>the Father judgeth no man.</hi> Now the Father as God, and the Son as God have but one judgment, and they do proceed by the ſame rule; and if the Father cannot judge them but he muſt deſtroy them, then neither can the Son as God; for they have one and the ſame will and judgment: but ſuppoſing a Mediator, one that will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to give God ſatisfaction for ſin, then the world may ſtand, and it is fit that he ſhould rule it that hath bought it; he hath bought the perſons of the Saints, and the ſervices of all the creatures for their good; therefore it is by Chriſt that the world ſtands, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is put into his hand as Mediator; for had not there been a Mediator, the world muſt have periſhed under the weight of the firſt tranſgreſſion; but that the world might ſtand, and men live in the world in their ſucceſſive generations, and ſo by grace at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain holineſs and glory, for this cauſe there was power given him over all fleſh; and this is the reaſon given by <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> why the Father judges not immediately, <hi>Patris noſtri ſive Divinae naturae judicium cum peccatoribus agentis eſt juxta ſeveritatem &amp; rigorem legis divinae, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. He could not give them eternal life elſe, becauſe he could not order all things for their ſpiritual good, even all the motions of the creatures, all the temptations of Satan, all the affections of men, either good or bad, ſometimes in ways of love and courteſie, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in ways of diſpleaſure and perſecution, and all providential occurrences; ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of ſervice, and ſuch occaſions of ſinning, which he hath the ordering of for the good of his people: <hi>All things do work together for good to them that love God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.28.</note> becauſe all of them are in the hand of a Mediator, for this very end and purpoſe, that he might order all things ſo as might conduct them ſafe to heaven: how comes it to paſs, that all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do ſervice to the Saints, and there is not one of them that can do them a diſſervice in reference to their ſpiritual eſtates? <hi>Cyrus</hi> in ways of kindneſs ſhall be drawn out to the ſervice of God, <hi>My ſhepherd,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>he ſhall be;</hi> and wicked men <hi>ſhall wipe them as a man doth a diſh,</hi> &amp;c. the fire ſhall not burn them, the water ſhall not drown them, <hi>no weapon formed againſt thee ſhall proſper,</hi> &amp;c. All this is becauſe that the adminiſtration of all things are put into the hand of a Mediator for their eternal good, and he will order all things ſo as they ſhall conduce unto that great end for which he hath undertaken the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the Kingdom of Providence, it's all in order to the ſpiritual Kingdom, it was purely out of the love of the Father to the Saints, that he did give the Kingdom unto Chriſt, and it was purely out of love to the Saints that he did accept of it; and thus <hi>the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:52030:215"/> Lord laid help on one that's mighty:</hi> Chriſt the Mediator doth adminiſter all things for their good, and that both in the ſpiritual and in the providential kingdom. In the ſpiritual kingdom all the Ordinances are for their good, it is for the edification of the Saints, and the building up of the body of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.12. all the inſtitutions of Chriſt are for their good, and all the motions of the Spirit, in what kind ſoever, and the deſertions of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,<note place="margin">Cant. 4. <hi>ult.</hi>

We ſee in the ſtory of the four Monarchies, how they all wrought for their own ruine, and the Churches advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the end, and that they did all but lift at the Church as at a burdenſom ſtone, and they themſelves were broken thereby, all tended to the Churches glory and greatneſs: <hi>And the mountain of the Lords houſe ſhall be exalted upon the top of the mountains, and new Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem ſhall come down from God out of heaven,</hi> and all Nations ſhall come unto the Church, and bring their glory unto it, and lick the duſt under the ſoals of their feet; the Lord will make it manifeſt to the world, that they are a people that he hath loved; and therefore 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21, 22. <hi>All things are yours, things preſent and things to come, all are yours;</hi> the vials that are now poured out, Chriſt hath the ordering of them, and they ſhall all of them make for the good of the Church in the end.</p>

                     </label> §. 1. HAving thus in general manifeſted the truth of the point, that there is a twofold Kingdom of God, <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>providential,</hi> and that both theſe are committed into the hands of the Mediator, and both are committed unto him for the Churches ſake; we muſt now come unto the particulars, that we may ſee how all the Soveraigny of God is made over and laid out for the good of his people. I ſhall begin firſt with the <hi>ſpiritual Kingdom,</hi> how that is ours, and what intereſt we have in the Soveraignty of God in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence thereunto, and ſo the Obſervation is, <hi>That the Supremacy or Soveraignty of God in reference to the ſpiritual Kingdom is made over to the Saints.</hi> The ſpiritual Kingdom is either in <hi>Grace</hi> or <hi>Glory,</hi> Chriſt rules in them both. Now in the handling of this I ſhall propoſe to you, (1) The <hi>Subjects</hi> in this Kingdom, who they are; and having ſhewed that Chriſt
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:52030:215"/> is the King, and unto what this kingdom doth extend (for the matter about which both the kingdoms are converſant is to be preſerved as diſtinct.) (2) The <hi>Agents</hi> or <hi>Officers</hi> that Chriſt doth imploy in the government of the ſpiritual kingdom under him. (3) The <hi>Laws</hi> of this kingdom by which he doth govern them. (4) The end or the intent of Chriſt in this government; for what it is that he doth in this manner rule them. (5) The <hi>Enemies</hi> of this kingdom (for all kingdoms have their enemies) and how they are in this kingdom ordered and ſubdued. (6) The <hi>puniſhments</hi> in this ſpiritual kingdom, and they are alſo ſpiritual, according to the double Covenant by which Chriſt doth diſpenſe himſelf, an inward and an outward Covenant, ſome being in Covenant in truth and reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſome by profeſſion only. (7) The <hi>Rebels</hi> againſt this kingdom, who are within it, and profeſs to ſubject themſelves unto the Laws of it, and yet do rebel againſt this kingdom. (8) The <hi>conſummation</hi> or the <hi>perfection</hi> of this kingdom, when grace ſhall be ſwallowed up in glory, and when the kingdom of grace ſhall bring in the kingdom of glory, unto which men are in this kingdom but in a way of preparation to be made meet, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. and if it do appear that the Soveraignty of Chriſt in all theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars is made over unto the Saints, and exerciſed for their good, then it will be clear, that they have an intereſt in the ſpiritual kingdom, and that his Soveraignty over it is theirs, and by Covenant belongs unto them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Concerning the <hi>Subjects</hi> of this ſpiritual Kingdom; for if the two Kingdoms and the Lords government in them be diſtinct, then we muſt keep the Subjects of theſe Kingdoms diſtinct through the whole diſcourſe. The ſpiritual Kingdom I conceive to have for its Subjects only thoſe that live in the Church, and that belong to it; for out of the Church of Chriſt he hath no ſpiritual Kingdom; for this is a Kingdom adminiſtred by Ordinances and the workings of the Spirit in them, and by them. Not that even in the Church there is not concurrent a providential Kingdom, for that is univerſal, and it's that of which it's ſaid, <hi>Thy kingdom rules over all;</hi> he hath not a limited Kingdom as other Princes have,<note place="margin">Pſal. 103.19.</note> that hath its bounds, for God hath ſet men the bounds of their Dominion, as well as of their habitation: 'tis ſaid, <hi>The head of Syria is Damaſcus,</hi>

Now as there are two parts of the ſecond Covenant, external and internal, ſo is there a double adminiſtration of the ſpiritual Kingdom; for according as men come under the Covenant, ſo are they ſaid to belong unto this Kingdom; for Chriſt receives all by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and rules all by Covenant, and all our intereſt is by a Covenant, and grounded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. Now that there is a twofold being in Covenant is clear, in that all <hi>Iſrael</hi> were called the Lords Covenant people and the children of the Covenant, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.25. that is, they came into the Covenant, as it were by right of inheritance, by deſcent, by a paternal right, and yet with many of them God was not well pleaſed; and as they were called <hi>the children of the Covenant,</hi> in the ſame ſenſe they are called <hi>the children of the Kingdom, Mat.</hi> 8.12. and ſo <hi>Grotius</hi> obſerves, <hi>Filii regni ex foederis privilegio dicuntur, &amp;c.</hi> yet they were caſt into utter darkneſs, where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth. You have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready heard there is a twofold being in Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.2, 3. <hi>Every branch in me that bears not fruit he takes away,</hi> &amp;c. and there are ſome that belong to the Kingdom of Grace in reſpect of the externals of it only, who have a right unto the outward priviledges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and there are ſome that belong to it in reſpect of the graces of it, and the eternal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits thereof, in whoſe ſoul Chriſt rules and dwells. Now the Kingdom of Grace or the ſpiritual Kingdom doth extend not only unto thoſe in the Church, in whoſe ſouls Chriſt dwells, being born again, but over whom he rules by his Ordinances, in reſpect of an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion and a viſible conformity, and have thereby an outward right according unto the external rules and dominion that Chriſt hath over them, and the outward ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which they yield unto him; and therefore have a title unto the external privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:52030:216" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the Subjects of the ſpiritual Kingdom, and therefore even the branches that are afterwards broken off are ſaid to partake of the ſap and fatneſs of the good Olive-tree, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17. Now the Dominion that Chriſt hath in the Kingdom of Grace, whether it be in the hearts of the Saints, over whom he rules by a ſpirit of regeneration, or whether in the hearts of Formaliſts, who are brought into ſubjection by a profeſſion only, yet it will appear, that in this Soveraignty over both the Saints have an intereſt, and the Lord Jeſus doth rule over both for the Saints ſake and for their good.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The ſpiritual Kingdom as it is in the ſouls of the Saints;</hi> thoſe that are new-born unto God, and have a mighty work of regeneration paſſed upon them, by which they have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up themſelves unto Chriſt, having by a perfect ſelf-reſignation put the rule and the government wholly out of their own hands into the hands of Chriſt, and have done it with chearfulneſs, and by way of election have <hi>given the hand unto the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.8. have <hi>given themſelves unto the Lord,</hi>

(2) It ſignifies <hi>oblationes vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntariae, gifts and free-will offerings, Deut.</hi> 23.23. and ſo the meaning is, that the people ſhould come to Chriſt, and give themſelves to him of their own accord, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing or any compelling, it ſhould be freely their own act.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Wherein doth this ſpiritual Kingdom conſiſt, which he doth exerciſe over the Saints?</hi> It's a Throne that Chriſt ſets up in the Conſcience, which doth order and command the whole man, and that in the name and by the authority of God.

(1) It's conſcience that doth receive the diſcharge for the man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.9. therefore a man is ſaid to be made <hi>perfect</hi> according unto the conſcience, ſo that when a mans conſcience is acquitted from guilt, and purged from pollution, it's then ſaid to be made <hi>perfect,</hi> and the man is perfected thereby; and for this cauſe conſcience hath an account to give of the man, in reference unto all that office and authority in the man that Chriſt hath ſet him over, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Their conſciences accuſing them,</hi> it hath the power over the man in all perſons: it was in the Creation ſet over man by God, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing renewed, it is now ſet over the man by Chriſt, and when he comes to give an account (for we muſt all give an account of our ſelves to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.12.) what is it in the man that ſhall give an account for him? it is conſcience that muſt make up our account at the laſt and great day, and in the Saints then will the Lord paſs a ſentence in conſcience, and he will acquit it from its viatory office, that hath a charge of the whole man. It's a great honour and a great truſt, and it is a great burden to take the charge of the man, and make an account for all ordinances, all mercies, all motions of the Spirit of God, all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of ſervice that the man has had in this life. (2) Becauſe the main guilt of the man is charged upon the conſcience, as that by which all ſin came in, it's neglecting its duty, and holding a league and a confederacy with ſin, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Their conſciences are defiled,</hi> and it is by this that ſin comes in, and for this cauſe the wrath that is poured upon the man will come in by his conſcience, it will be as it were the funnel by which God will pour wrath into the whole ſoul, becauſe thereby Satan poured ſin into the whole ſoul; and for that cauſe the torment for ever lies mainly in the conſcience, and it ſhall be the faculty that ſhall torment the whole man, it's the <hi>worm that never dyes,</hi> it is only the acts of conſcience, the ſoul turning in upon it ſelf, and its former ways, and paſt hopes for ever: now that which was the great Officer here, that ſhall give its account, and be chiefly acquitted hereafter; glory in heaven comes in by the conſcience, and torment in hell will come in by the conſcience; for there is the Throne of Chriſt mainly erected, the myſtery of faith and of holineſs, all is kept in a pure conſcience, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>This Rule and Dominion Chriſt only hath in the hearts of the Saints;</hi> he has ſuch a rule over them as he has over none elſe in the world. 1. The relations in which he ſtands to them do bind him to it, for he is their head, and they are his body: now Chriſt as their head is not only a head of eminence, which he is to other creatures alſo, but of guidance,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:52030:217"/> that is, he doth give them his Spirit to be <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. It's true, that all mankind in the Fall did put themſelves out of the protection of God and his guidance, and therefore the Lord did juſtly ſuffer them to walk in their own ways, and he might have ſuffered the brute crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to prey upon them, or men to devour one another as <hi>the fiſhes of the Sea that have no King, Hab.</hi> 1.13. but becauſe the Lord will have the ſtage of this world ſtand for the Elects ſake; therefore he has committed the providential Kingdom unto the Son alſo, who takes all men into protection for the preſervation of the world; but he takes none into his ſpecial protection for their preſervation and his peculiar guidance, but thoſe that are his people by a peculiar Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are none other that give up themſelves unto his guidance; he will not force himſelf upon any people to be their King, though he has a right, for the kingdom is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him by God the Father, yet if he <hi>come to his own they receive him not, Joh.</hi> 1.11. he will not force himſelf upon them to be their King;<note place="margin">Luk. 19.14.</note> they that ſay, <hi>We will not have this man to rule over us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 110.3.</note> he will deſtroy them; but there are a people upon whom a day of almighty power doth paſs that ſubdues their wills, and commands their conſciences, and they do ſubmit unto his guidance, they would have no other Lord, and it is their miſery that it ſhould be ſo that ſin ſhould at any time reign in them, and they complain of it; other Lords beſides thee have had dominion over us, but we will acknowledge and owne no other, ſin ſhall not have dominion over us; they will give that honour unto none but unto their King, and they do rejoyce in their King that they have ſuch a Ruler, and they do willingly and chearfully follow him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider the happineſs and bleſſed condition of the Saints under this Government of Chriſt, which will appear in theſe particulars. (1) He doth rule them with juſtice, it's a kingdom of righteouſneſs that he ſets up in their ſouls, for he is <hi>Melchiſedeck, the King of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and we have a kingdom of ſin in us, and therefore is ſin ſaid to reign in our mortal bodies, and therefore he muſt have a kingdom of righteouſneſs: grace is ſaid to reign by Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.21. he rules his people with righteouſneſs, and ſets up a righteous Throne in the conſciences of men. (2) He rules them with wiſdom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.20. <hi>He will bring forth judgment unto victory;</hi> there is a wiſdom in the government of Chriſt that ſhall be victorious. Men are fooliſh in their government, we read in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4.13. of an old King that was fooliſh, <hi>delirant reges,</hi> they do many times take courſes that are not the wiſeſt for the peoples good; but Chriſt takes the wiſeſt courſes for the good of his people, and none can prevail againſt his wiſdom. (3) He rules them with meekneſs, <hi>I am meek and lowly in heart:</hi> as it's an argument to ſubject to his teaching, ſo unto his rule, for he is not harſh in his government, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 40. <hi>He doth bear his lambs in his boſom, he doth gently lead them that are with young;</hi> whereas men are cruel, their poſſeſſors ſlay them, and hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not guilty, their own ſhepherds pity them not; therefore the Lord will give every man into the hand of his brother, and into the hand of his King; but Chriſt rules his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with tenderneſs, <hi>he will not break the bruiſed reed, nor quench the ſmoaking flax,</hi> &amp;c. (4) He will give them ſtrength to obey, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me,</hi> he commands and enables us to obey, <hi>jubet &amp; juvat,</hi> he puts under his hand, ſo that we offer to him of his own in what we give him, and it is with his own ſtrength that we do ſerve him, <hi>he works all our works in us and for us;</hi> there is a creating power in the commandment; <hi>for as in the promiſe he creates peace, ſo in the commandment he gives power;</hi> it is <hi>ſtand up and walk,</hi> it puts a power into him, for it is a creating word, the very word of his power puts a power in us for the work. (5) He rules them in peace, and there is a ſafety under his government,<note place="margin">Eſa. 32.1, 2.</note> 
                     <hi>a hiding place from the wind, a covering from the tempeſt;</hi> there ſhall be all in this government that we can ſtand in need of, he is the King of <hi>Salem,</hi> and the Prince of peace, all his ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all his paths are peace, and men never depart from peace till they do forſake his government, and ſubject themſelves unto another Lord. (6) His government leads unto life; for there is a life to be had in obedience to him, he is called the Prince of life, that is, he hath a power given him to diſpenſe life as the Prince of it, and he doth give it to whomſoever he has undertaken to
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:52030:217"/> rule, if he be a King of Righteouſneſs to them, he is alſo a Prince of life, he doth all for the good of his people, it's for their ſakes that all the government is managed that he has undertaken in the world. Now if we conſider how many ſons of <hi>Belial</hi> there are that live without a yoke, and conſider that they have no Law but the wills of the fleſh and of the mind, the Law of ſin and death, we ſhall all ſay, O bleſſed is the man whom the Lord rules and reigns over, the Lord rules and reigns, let the Saints rejoyce, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (7) In his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment they do behold him in his glory; for he that doth rule in them, doth alſo dwell in them as in a Temple; and he walks amongſt them continually, <hi>Eſa</hi> 33.17. <hi>Thine eyes ſhall ſee the King in his glory.</hi> Now there are many men that are ruled by Kings that never ſee them; but this is a Court where they may ſee their King, and it is the Palace of the great King, where he is always to be ſeen by his Subjects, the meaneſt as well as the greateſt, <hi>non factio, ſed curia dicenda eſt, Cyprian.</hi> It's not a government at a diſtance in remote parts, but ſo as he takes up his dwelling place there, and they are joyful in their King; let the children of <hi>Zion</hi> be joyful in their King always, but never ſo much as when they ſee him in glory. (8) They have a communion with his perſon all the while: there are many that have a benefit by his government that have no fellowſhip with his perſon; but the <hi>Queen,</hi> the <hi>Bride,</hi> the <hi>Lambs wife,</hi> ſhe has the fruit of his government and communion with his perſon, and delights in his love and in his glory alſo, and the King ſits at his round table, and we eat with him, we ſup with him, and our ſouls rejoyce in his ſalvation, <hi>his left hand is under our head, and his right hand embraceth us, he brings us into his banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-houſe, and the banner of love is over us,</hi> as a Bridegroom over his Bride; while he rules us as a King, he doth delight in us, and we have communion with him, as a husband con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</p>

(1) That the ſpiritual kingdom of God doth not only extend to his rule over the Saints which are his ſubjects by election and regeneration, but alſo that there is a great deal of dominion which he has even over them that are the ſubjects of this kingdom only by profeſſion. (2) That the rule and dominion that Chriſt doth exerciſe over theſe, is for the ſake and for the good of the Saints, and that they themſelves have no benefit by it in the end; but all doth turn unto the advantage and the ſpiritual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of them that are heirs of ſalvation; ſo that the adminiſtration unto unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men, as members of the Church viſible, is for the good of thoſe that are members of the Church inviſible.</p>

Yet while they do live, and in outward ſhew continue the ſubjects of this kingdom, ſo long they are to be looked upon in outward ſhew as ſubjects, and the priviledges of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects belong unto them, they are ſervants, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.35. <hi>But the ſervant abides not in the houſe

But they ſhall not continue ſubjects of this kingdom always; though for a ſeaſon the tares and the wheat, the ſheep and the goats may ſtand together till the day of ſeparation, good and bad be in the net together, till the one be gathered into the veſſel, and the bad be caſt away; for though the ſpiritual king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in reſpect of Chriſt ſhall have no end, but Chriſt ſhall be ſo a King in glory, that he ſhall never ceaſe to be a <hi>head of eminence,</hi> or of <hi>influence,</hi> or of <hi>guidance</hi> (for the myſtical Union ſhall never be broken) no more than the hypoſtatical, yet his kingdom in reſpect of thoſe that profeſs it, is but for the time of this life; <hi>natural worſhip ſhall be in glory, and they are only Saints that worſhip Chriſt therewith;</hi> but there is <hi>inſtituted worſhip</hi> that is only for the time of this life, and it is in this that they worſhip him, and become ſubjects to him,<note place="margin">Mat. 8.12.</note> but <hi>the children of the kingdom ſhall be caſt out at the laſt, Joh.</hi> 15.2. there are bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that bear no fruit in this Vine, and they are caſt out as a branch and wither; but du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of their continuance in this kingdom till he has caſt them out for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, there is a government that the Lord Jeſus by his Spirit doth exerciſe towards them and over them for the good of his Saints. And this will appear by the expreſſions that we meet with in Scripture. (1) They are his ſervants, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.35. the Church is compared to a <hi>houſe,</hi> a <hi>family,</hi> as it's called <hi>the family of God,</hi> and <hi>the houſe of God;</hi> and of this family Chriſt is the Maſter: now there is a ſpecial imployment that he has for every one of his ſervants, and they are under his ſpecial command and dominion; it is true, this family is made up of ſervants and of ſons, and the ſervants may have a greater rule in the houſe than the ſons, but yet both under the authority of the houſholder, only he rules over the one as a <hi>Maſter,</hi> and over the other as a <hi>Father,</hi> but both are in ſubjection. <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.8. there are in the Church <hi>ſixty Queens, and fourſcore Concubines, and Virgins without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> ſome are truly married unto Chriſt, and have a true right and authority in the family by their marriage-union with the King, for the woman ſhines by the beams of her husband; but there are Concubines that came in only for luſts ſake, and that did bear fruit, but it was never from a marriage ſtate; and there were Virgins that were companions only, that were not married, neither did they in a manner bear fruit, but were for attendants only, and the King has a ſpecial rule and dominion over all theſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (2) The Church viſible is compared to a <hi>great Houſe,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.20. ſome expound it <hi>de mundo,</hi> but <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>textus nos ducit, ut de Eccleſia intelligamus; non de extraneis diſputat Apoſtolus, ſed de ipſa fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia Dei, Calv.</hi> there is not a veſſel but it has its uſe, though all have not the ſame uſe, nor of the like honour, yet all are for uſe, and all are for the Maſters uſe; ſo that there is a ſpecial dominion that is exerciſed over them all, as well the veſſels of wood and ſtone, as thoſe that are of gold, to imploy them where he will, and as he will, in what ſervice he pleaſes; for it is his will that makes their uſe to differ; it is for the Saints ſake that he makes uſe of them; ſo that all Gods diſpenſations towards unregenerate men in the Church is for their ſakes, all the husbandry that is exerciſed about the unfruitful branches is for the ſake of thoſe that have a bleſſing in them; for the wicked ſhall have no benefit by it in the great day of the Lord; the greater rule the Lord has exerciſed towards men, the greater will their abhorring be, <hi>the nearer they have been to him, the further off ſhall they be from him,</hi> the higher they have been exalted to heaven, the deeper ſhall they be caſt down to hell, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.23. there is <hi>utter darkneſs</hi> for the children of the kingdom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.12. And this we may reduce unto four Heads, (1) their graces, (2) their gifts, (3) their ſervices, (4) their ſins, and in all theſe the dominion of Chriſt over them is for the good of the Saints.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Their graces are ruled by Chriſt for the Saints: there are common graces which the Lord doth give unto unregenerate men in the Church, common illuminations, by which they ſee much glory and beauty in ſpiritual things, and yet had never their eyes anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with eye-ſalve; and there are many common works upon the wills of men letting in a taſte of the goodneſs of ſpiritual things, ſo that the heart is much taken with them, and makes out after them; and there are many tendencies to the new birth, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.13. we ſee them ſet forth to us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.3, 4. which is meant of the common graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt under the Goſpel, which he works upon the ſouls and conſciences of unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men, which are only from the Spirit <hi>aſſiſting,</hi> and not from the Spirit <hi>informing,</hi> which flow not from union, but from conviction; and therefore from which in time they will ſurely fall away: there is a great beauty that the Spirit of God in ſuch common works doth put forth upon the ſouls of unregenerate men, though it be but as the Sun ſhining upon a mud-wall, or as a curious robe put upon a dead carkaſs, it cannot keep it
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:52030:218"/> from ſtinking, becauſe there is not a principle of life in it. (1) Hereby the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains their ſpirits. There is a reſtraint without by a power that is upon the Devil, by which he is reſtrained from doing the miſchief he would elſe do; but there is a reſtraint within upon the luſts of men, and that is by ſome ſpecial works of the Spirit of God upon them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.24. <hi>No man ſhall deſire thy land,</hi> &amp;c. and the Spirit <hi>reſtraining</hi> is for the Saints ſake as well as the Spirit renewing, <hi>Pſal</hi> 76:10. <hi>The wrath of man ſhall praiſe thee,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 76.10.</note> 
                     <hi>and the remainder of wrath thou ſhalt reſtrain,</hi>

                     <hi>accinges,</hi> thou ſhalt gird up; ſometimes the Lord lets mens luſts looſe, and ſometimes he does gird them up as he doth the Sea in a girdle of ſand, or elſe the Saints of God, who are always as ſheep amongſt wolves, would ſurely be devoured by them, for their <hi>ſoul is amongst lyons.</hi> Now they are common works that do exceedingly reſtrain the ſins and the rage of unregenerate men, and bind up their ſpirits both in reference unto perſecution and the wrongs done by them, as alſo in reference to corruption and the evil example given by them alſo.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) Hereby the Lord doth fit them for ſervice; for even the veſſels of diſhonour are for ſervice in the houſe alſo, though they be but of wood and ſtone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now though gifts do immediately qualifie them, yet they are common works that do make them to exerciſe thoſe gifts, and are unto them as oyl to the wheels in the uſe of them; as a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Believer he may be an eminent Profeſſor, and the houſe that ſuch a one builds is far more glorious in outward ſhew than that of a Saint, for they are both called builders, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.7. and many men do ſervice for God, but they are cold in it, becauſe they are acted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from without, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.18. whoſe God is their belly, <hi>Non ità glacies &amp; frigus ſicut Elcius &amp; alii, ſed ego rem ſeriam agebam, ut quòd diem extremum horribiliter timui, &amp;c. Luth.</hi> and this will make a man ſeem to act from an inward principle, as if he had received life from the Spirit, and were made alive from the dead; and thereby even ungodly men do many times give a great teſtimony unto the principles and the practices of the Saints, that they acknowledge them and ſeal unto them, and yet nevertheleſs there is in them a principle to hate them, and that will vent it ſelf in time, when the thorns ſhall ſpring up to choak the word, notwithſtanding all the reſtraints that are upon their luſts for a ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) Thereby they do good many times, and give great encouragements to the Saints by their example; for their lamps do ſhine as lights in the world, and there are many that do ſhew others the way, in which they themſelves walk not, but they have their <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verticula,</hi> their <hi>crooked ways,</hi> they go forth with the people of God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 125.5.</note> and yet they do after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards repent themſelves, and turn back again from the way that's called holy, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. Godly men do not only follow the example of the Saints, that is, thoſe that are real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly ſo, but they have many times very great encouragement from the example and the countenance of them that are not ſo, as we ſee it in the inſtance of <hi>Joaſh,</hi> how he did encourage the builders of the Temple; eſpecially when they are men in authority and power, they do encourage and go before the Saints of God, unto the end whereof they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come; and ſo we have much experienced in our days.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By their gifts alſo; no man hath his gifts for himſelf, they are this worlds goods, they are not thy own, but another mans, as thy riches are: and they are the Churches Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and they will fall from a man when he dyes, as <hi>Elijahs</hi> mantle; for they are of no uſe in the world to come, and therefore ſhall not continue, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8, 9. they are (1) for the Churches collection, that ſo they may be inſtrumental in gathering in others. As for that diſpute, <hi>Whether a man that is unregenerate is made uſe of by God to convert others?</hi> I ſhall not now inſiſt on; but I conceive the power of converſion being not of man, but of God, the Lord calling ſuch as belong to the Election, doth according to his good pleaſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with the one as with the other; the gifts of the Miniſtry are <hi>for the gathering of the Saints, Eph.</hi> 4. many of them are unregenerate men, and yet have received a gift, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.21. and can ſay to Chriſt, <hi>We have propheſied in thy name;</hi> yet are caſt-aways themſelves; for Chriſt has <hi>received gifts for men, yea for the rebellious alſo,</hi> that the Lord God might dwell amongſt them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18. that is, that the Lord might have a Church for a habitation amongſt them, <hi>Habes ingenium verè aureum</hi> (ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi> of <hi>Lycentius) &amp; diabolo propinas teipſum. Deus populo ſuo tam per pios quàm per impios magna facere &amp; donare poteſt, Luth. Golden wits may be the Devils vaſſals.</hi> (2) For the perfection of the Saints; for during the ſtanding of this great houſe the veſſels ſhall continue, and there will be a continual uſe of them, that though they ſerve their luſts, yet by the uſe of their gifts the Lords ends are accompliſhed, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.18. Some preach Chriſt out of envy, but yet Chriſt is preached, and thereby the ſavour of the Goſpel is ſpread abroad, and ſouls are converted and edified; for there is many a man that builds an Ark that ſaves others, that never ſaves himſelf, that preaches to others, and is himſelf a caſt-away; there were many that converted others to the Faith in the times of Popery, that yet departed themſelves from
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:52030:219"/> that Faith when ſuffering came; <hi>And I fear it will alſo be ſaid of ſome Miniſters now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, that ſeem great Zealots for the cauſe and ways of God, that when the hour and power of darkneſs that is coming once again in this Nation ſhall over-ſpread it, they will draw back from the plough, to which they have before ſo many witneſſes put their hand,</hi> &amp;c. the love of many ſhall wax cold.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All their ſervices alſo; for they have gifts for ſervice, and it is for the ſervice of the houſe, and they are therefore called ſervants; and truly it's an honour to be a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to the Saints, ſeeing the Angels are ſo; and there is much benefit that the Saints have by it, as we ſee in <hi>Saul,</hi> the ſpirit of government was upon him, and that ſervice he did in it was for the Saints; and <hi>Zac.</hi> 4.12. they are ſaid to <hi>empty the golden oyl out of themſelves,</hi> &amp;c. but it is all for the good of the Candleſtick, it is that the light thereof may be maintained. (1) Sometimes they protect as Badgers skins the Ark from ſtorms that the Church is expoſed to; unregenerate men may be very ſerviceable to the Church of God, as we ſee in <hi>Cyrus,</hi> &amp;c. (2) Sometimes they may aſſiſt them in any work that they ſet upon, they may ſtand by them, and ſtrengthen their hands, as we ſee <hi>Joaſh</hi> the King did about the building and repairing the Houſe of the Lord. (3) Sometimes they may ſupply them; there is many a man that ſupplies the neceſſities of the Saints, that doth it to be ſeen of men, and have their reward; for they are labourers in the Lords Vineyard, and it is for the benefit of it that they are imployed, and they have their penny, and they may alſo bear much of the burden and heat of the day, as it ſeems they that murmured did, and they do commonly ſet a high price upon their own ſervices: and hereby the Saints do glorifie Chriſt, who has given ſuch gifts to men; and when he hath given ſuch to his enemies, O what are thoſe gifts that he hath reſerved for his ſons! They ſee it is the great fruit of the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, and as from the ſeven Spirits that are before the Throne; and they can bleſs God for his goodneſs to the children of men; and though they pity ſuch a ſoul to ſee him deſtroyed by his own gifts, in his abuſing of them, <hi>non eſt calamitoſior homo in terris quàm doctor ſuperbus, There is not a more piteous man in the world than a proud Doctor, Luth.</hi> yet they glorifie Chriſt therein, and ſee this as a fruit of his government, that there may be thoſe that ſhall build the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of God, as it is ſaid of <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab</hi> that they were gifted for the work, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. By their ſins; for (1) the Lord doth let them live for the Saints ſake, lets both good and bad grow together to the harveſt, and he will weed them out for the Saints ſake alſo; for he will gather out of his Kingdom <hi>all that offends, and whoever works iniquity;</hi> and he will not have the ſociety of the Saints always polluted by the chaff of the world, for they are ſpots in their feaſts, and therefore he doth take them away as unfruitful fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, he cuts them down and gives them to ſalt, to a perpetual barrenneſs; for the grace and ordinances of the Goſpel will heal even the dead ſea, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 47.11, 12. therefore he caſts them out in order to their deſtruction. (2) The Lord will not have his people al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways deluded: the Saints many times are miſtaken in their opinion of perſons, they may as <hi>Eli</hi> did miſreprove a <hi>Hannah</hi> in the Church of God, and as <hi>David</hi> believe a <hi>Zibi</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſon of his friend; for commonly the beſt deſerving Chriſtians are clouded by the glaring light of the lamps of Hypocrites, who make it their buſineſs to raiſe falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports againſt ſuch as outſhine them in true grace and holineſs; but at laſt God will diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them and caſt them out of the Churches prayers and affection, they ſhall not always abide with them,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.18.</note> that they may be made manifeſt not to be of them: and they that are approved ſhall be made manifeſt; and ſo ſhall they that are corrupted alſo, they ſhall be found lyars, and they ſhall be caſt out, the Lord will cut them off, that they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the expectations of the Saints no more; the Lord doth delight to do it, and we ſhould wait his leiſure in it, who will certainly ſhew himſelf a God that judges in the earth. (3) That thereby the Saints may be awakened and admoniſhed; when <hi>Hymeneus</hi> fell, then 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.7. is that exhortation moſt ſeaſonable, <hi>Let him that names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity, and let him that thinks he ſtands take heed leſt he fall:</hi> when a man obſerves <hi>horrendas tempeſtates &amp; flenda naufragia, horrid tempeſts,</hi> it is a hint to the Saints, look to your ſtanding, ſee that you be built upon a Rock, that ſtorms and tempeſts may not overthrow you.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In their judgments; for they are terrible judgments that the Lord doth execute upon unregenerate men in the Church, <hi>there are no mercies like thoſe out of Sion, and there are no judgments like them;</hi> no men are ſo eminently under the curſe as they are: <hi>Out of the Throne came thundering, and lightning, and voices, Rev.</hi> 4.5. for the Churches ſake and by their prayers.

                  <p>Let us ſee this by an enumeration of ſome particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If the Lord give unto his people proſperity, it ſhall be to the advantage of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, and in their outward proſperity their ſouls ſhall proſper, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.6. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſaphat had ſilver and gold and riches in abundance, and his heart was lifted up and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the ways of Gods commandments;</hi> and thereby the people of God make them friends of the unrighteous Mammon, and <hi>they lay up a good foundation, that they may lay hold of eternal life;</hi> Eccleſ. 7.11. <hi>Wiſdom is good with an inheritance;</hi> it is good in it ſelf without an inheritance, but there is a ſpecial advantage by wiſdom with an inheritance, and ſo it's better to the man; or it is good to a mans ſelf, but it is not ſo good unto another; and ſo <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.24. <hi>The crown of the wiſe is their riches;</hi> but there are to other men riches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the hurt of the owner, and <hi>the proſperity of fools ſhall deſtroy them, Prov.</hi> 1.32. wiſdom is the better with an inheritance, but folly is the worſe with an inheritance; <hi>for the folly of fools is fooliſhneſs;</hi> he ſpeaks it of rich fools, there are no men diſcover their folly more, and whoſe fooliſhneſs is more eminent and notorious than theſe mens; as riches draw forth the graces of the one, ſo do they alſo the ſins of the other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the Lord give unto his people afflictions, it ſhall be to the advantage of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Tribulation works patience:</hi> ſurely patience is a fruit of the Spirit, as all other graces are, and cannot be wrought in any man by affliction, unleſs it be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him by the Spirit.

                     </gap>, <hi>that enemy,</hi> in two things to the Saints: (1) In his accuſations unto God; he is therefore called the Accuſer of the Brethren, and ſo he did move God againſt <hi>Job</hi> to deſtroy him without a cauſe, <hi>Job</hi> 2.3. there was cauſe enough in <hi>Job,</hi> if the Lord had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme to mark what he had done amiſs; but there was not that cauſe that Satan did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and it is a mercy to the people of God, that though there be cauſe enough, yet he doth hide the true cauſe from their malicious accuſers, that that which they faſten upon them is no cauſe to ſet God or man againſt them, but the more the Lord doth appear for his ſervants to juſtifie them; had not Satan accuſed <hi>Job</hi> ſo impetuouſly, God had never ſo eminently appeared for his juſtification. This ſhould quiet and comfort the Saints in all the hard meaſure and reproaches that they meet withal in the world, that yet the Lord will ariſe for their juſtification and their enemies confuſion; that though a child of God may lye under the blaſt of the wicked for a ſeaſon, yet God will vindicate him at laſt, ſo that falſe friends, as well as true enemies, ſhall be made to ſay, <hi>Surely there is no inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt any of the ſeed of Jacob;</hi>

(2) Satan is an enemy by his temptations unto the Saints, and ſo the ſtrength of God is made perfect in their weakneſs, that is, manifeſtly declared ſo to be, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. for thereby their ſtrength is tryed, there is nothing tries grace ſo much as tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation unto ſin, becauſe nothing is more oppoſite unto grace, and <hi>gratia vexata ſeipſam prodit, grace vexed diſcovers it ſelf:</hi> thereby alſo their corruption is purged, for the Lord doth commonly temper that poyſon into a medicine, and Satan that ſeeks to kill ſhall be inſtrumental to cure, he that doth intend to ſtab the man ſhall but give vent to his impoſthume; and therefore <hi>Luther</hi> ſays of temptation, when the Papiſts did object unto <hi>Luther,</hi> that he himſelf granted Purgatory, <hi>I do indeed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but it is but that Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of temptation,</hi> and he adds, <hi>Hoc Purgatorium non eſt fictum;</hi> and hereby the enemy is conquered; <hi>for we are more than conquerors, Rom.</hi> 8.

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Corruptions of men ſhall tend to the Saints ſpiritual advantage: though God is not the Author of ſin, yet he is the Orderer of it. (1) He doth not let out the corruptions of other men any further than for the good of his Saints: <hi>The wrath of man ſhall praiſe thee; no man ſhall deſire thy land; I ſuffered thee not to touch her;</hi> the Lord withholds men from hurting his people, and his reſtraining grace is not only upon their acts, but upon their corruptions alſo; ſo as they are not let out but unto the Saints ſpiritual advantage alſo. (2) Not only the corruptions of other men, but thoſe of the Saints themſelves; the falling out of any new and eminent fall the Lord will make as a new converſion, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32. <hi>When thou art converted ſtrengthen thy brethren;</hi> the foundation is laid anew, and there is alſo a renewing of juſtification, a more faſt application of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt: <hi>I will take away thy filthy garments, and I will cloath thee with change of raiment;</hi>

                     <hi>I have cauſed thy iniquity to paſs from thee;</hi> and this makes way for a glorious aſſurance and for an eminent imployment; for God ſets a Mitre or a Crown upon his head, and he was thereby fitted for the great work of the Temple, and taken into ſociety with them that ſtand by.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. All a mans imployment; it is a teſtimony that a man is a veſſel of honour, when in every condition he is fitted for the maſters uſe; and it's a token that a man is called unto any imployment in mercy, when he has the graces of that condition drawn forth; a man may be called to the Miniſtry or the Magiſtracy, but not in mercy, without this; there is an election to an imployment as well as to life, <hi>Paul</hi> was ſeparated from his mothers womb unto the Goſpel of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If <hi>David</hi> be a ſhepherd, he follows the Ews great with young, and he doth it with faithfulneſs, and if he be taken from the ſheepfold to feed <hi>Jacob</hi> the Lords people, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> his inheritance, he doth it with <hi>the integrity of his heart,</hi> and <hi>the skilfulneſs of his hand, Acts</hi> 13.22. <hi>Vis me conſtituere paſtorem ovium, aut regem populorum, ecce paratum eſt cor meum, &amp;c.</hi> ſometimes friends, ſometimes enemies, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the chief of the Princes were againſt <hi>David,</hi> but God was with him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Even death it ſelf and the agonies thereof: for even death it ſelf is yours, it is a ſervant, and not an enemy, becauſe it doth improve and further a mans ſpiritual intereſt. (1) As men <hi>dye in the Lord, Rev.</hi> 14.13. death is theirs by virtue of their union with Chriſt, that as they bear fruit in him, ſo they dye in him; death cannot diſſolve the union between a ſoul and Chriſt.

(3) It is a life of glory that death lets the Saints into, it opens the door unto a weight of eternal life, it doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the purer part of man, delivers him from the body of ſin; for he that is dead is freed from ſin, and it doth let him into the beatifical viſion, and thereby his ſanctification alſo is perfected: as it is recorded of <hi>Bernard</hi> when he was ſick unto death, there was a great while nothing heard of him but this, <hi>Tempus perdidi, quàm perditè vixi!</hi> but at laſt he adds, <hi>Hoc meum ſolatium, duplici in re Chriſtus regnum poſſidet, quà filius, quà paſſus, hoc ſecundo nihil ei opus fuit, ſed mihi dedit;</hi> and under this conſolation he fell aſleep.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All the creatures belong to the ſpiritual Kingdom <hi>reductivè,</hi> as they do belong to the priviledges of the Saints; for <hi>all things are yours, becauſe you are Chriſts;</hi> there is a double right, <hi>jus politicum &amp; evangelicum:</hi> now in this manner they belong to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Kingdom, 1. In reſpect of their continuance; for it is for their ſakes that the world ſtands. By virtue of the ancient curſe, <hi>Curſed be the ground for thy ſake,</hi> the earth would ſink under us, but that the Lord Jeſus did put under his hand and keep it from ruine by virtue of the new Covenant; therefore he is brought in as the <hi>upholder of all things, who alſo purged our ſins, and is ſate down at the right hand of the Majeſty on high, Heb.</hi> 1.3. for the Lord did not continue the creatures in their being to ſerve his enemies, but the ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of creatures depends upon the ſecond Covenant, as appears <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.21. and the Lord will ſurely manifeſt it in theſe two things. (1) In the latter days the Kingdom and Dominion of the whole Earth ſhall be taken out of the hands of the enemies, and ſhall be given into the hands of the Saints to the end of the world, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.18. and then all the wicked of the earth ſhall lick the duſt of their feet, and it is in order thereunto that it is continued to this day. (2) As ſoon as the Lord has gathered in the number of his Saints, and has perfected their graces, he will take down the ſtage of this world, and overturn it, that it ſhall be no more, at leaſt ſuch as now it is. Now they that are the heirs of this world, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed are called, they are tranſlating, and Gods children
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:52030:221"/> being called home, the Lord will not continue the world for ſervants, but he will break up houſe-keeping, and he will ſend every one of them unto their own place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the tares and the wheat do grow till the harveſt, but the Lord will not ſuffer the tares to grow again after the harveſt; and therefore the very continuation of the creatures belongs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſpiritual Kingdom as one part of the priviledges of the Saints.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The reſtitution of the creatures; for as they were made ſubject unto vanity by ſin, (for they all came under mans Covenant, and therefore you have heard in mans fall the curſe took hold upon them, they being made for the uſe of man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.20, 21.) they ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption; and therefore they wait for the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the glory of the ſons of God; not that all the creatures ſhall be continued in being, for many of them ſhall be conſumed in that laſt conflagration, but yet the ſubſtance ſhall continue as ſtanding monuments unto Gods glory, as matter of praiſe and of delight unto the Saints, which ſhall be begun in the laſt days of the world, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.21. there ſhall be a wonderful change in the creatures doubtleſs before the laſt day, when the <hi>Aſs ſhall eat clean fodder,</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. There is a ſpecial Providence over them above all the reſt of the Creation; it is true, that there is a general Providence of God that doth reach unto every thing, even the meaneſt and the vileſt creatures, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.29. a <hi>ſparrow,</hi> a <hi>hair; He doth whatever it pleaſes him in heaven and earth, and in the ſea,</hi> &amp;c. there is a Divine manuduction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and there is a concourſe; God has not ſet up a world to act of it ſelf, but there is and muſt be a concurrence, that is, (1) with all ſecond cauſes, or elſe they cannot act; this appears in the Furnace of <hi>Babylon,</hi> if the Lord do but ſuſpend his act, the creatures immediately work not; and therefore there is an immediate acting that is with all ſecond cauſes, <hi>cauſa prima concurrit immediatè cum omni agente creato, &amp;c.</hi> But (2) in a ſpecial manner over the Saints; for that's the ſcope of Chriſts reaſoning, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.29, &amp;c. <hi>Ye are of more value than many ſparrows;</hi> he that feeds the ravens and cloaths the lilies, will he not much more you, O ye of little faith? <hi>and not one of them is forgotten by your heavenly Father, vocula Pater tanta eſt in corde eloquentia quam Demoſthenes &amp; Cicero non poſſunt exprimere, &amp;c.

                     </gap>, <hi>There is nothing ſhall by any means hurt them.</hi> It is true, that they have enemies, they have one great enemy who is called <hi>the Envious man,</hi> and all the means that he can uſe is to turn every thing to their hurt, but they ſhall tread down all the power of the enemy, that none ſhall be able to hurt them; as it is ſaid of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, <hi>He ſuffered no man to do them wrong, but he reproved Kings for their ſakes;</hi> there were many that had a mind to do them wrong, but he ſuffered them not, and any that did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it, the Lord turned it into their good, and they did it not <hi>impunè,</hi> it was unto their own deſtruction,<note place="margin">Eſa. 49.17.</note> 
                     <hi>There is no weapon that is formed againſt thee ſhall proſper;</hi> and this is the inheritance of the ſervants of the Lord, it is that which belongs to them only, and that which they have a glorious title to, it is <hi>jure haereditario</hi> theirs, it deſcends unto them by their intereſt in God as their Father, and they that have God for their Father, have the
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:52030:223"/> ſecret Providence of God as their inheritance, ſo that there is nothing ſhall work againſt them, when God is for them. (2) Every thing ſhall work for their good and their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation: the ſtars ſhall fight for them, the Sea ſhall be a wall unto them, inſtead of drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, their very enemies ſhall favour them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.46. he gives them favour in the ſight of their enemies, and even <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſhall give charge concerning <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> when there was none concerning <hi>Zedekiah</hi> the King; and he will turn the curſe into a bleſſing, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.5. <hi>The Lord turned it into a bleſſing.</hi> To a wicked man every thing is for his hurt, what ſhould be for his welfare, that becomes his ſnare; but it is quite contrary unto a godly man, that which is intended for his hurt that is turned into good, and to a quite contrary end than that unto which it was by the enemy intended. Now when we ſee many cauſes with contrary purpoſes and intentions, all of them conſpire unto an end which they underſtand not, but ſeek and deſire the contrary, it muſt be ſaid, that there is a providence and a wiſe hand that did over-rule all this, for this is an end that was far from the intention of ſecond cauſes; for there is a peace with enemies, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.7. there is a Covenant with beaſts, as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.18. and there is a league with ſtones, <hi>Job</hi> 5.23. <hi>Dominium habet, cuſtodem habebit, &amp; lapides, &amp;c.</hi> and all this is nothing but an expreſſion of that ſpecial and ſecret providence of God that doth watch over his own people; ſo that this is the comfort and the inheritance of the Saints, that every thing in the whole government of the world is ſo ordered, that it ſhall do them no hurt, but all ſhall make for their good, who love him and fear him.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſet forth this in the particulars of it; we ſhall ſee that all things about which the providence of God is exerciſed, are ſo ruled, as that the government of them makes for the good of the Saints; and here I ſhall propound theſe five diſtinctions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Providence of God is either <hi>circa maxima, vel minima.</hi> (1) The greateſt things in the world are not above the providence of God, neither are the ſmalleſt things below it: <hi>He doth whatever he will in heaven and in earth, and in the ſea. It is not what the creatures will,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.91.</note> 
                     <hi>but it is what he will;</hi> all are his ſervants, the very Angels in Heaven do his pleaſure, and they hearken unto his voice; and the greateſt of men, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.16, 17. the moſt high rules in the Kingdoms of mortal men, he puts down the mighty from their ſeat, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts them of low degree, <hi>deponit reges, diſponit regna,</hi> Ezech. 21.10. <hi>It is the rod of my ſon contemning every tree,</hi> &amp;c. (2) There is not the ſmalleſt thing but it is ordered by him, there is not a worm that creeps upon the ground, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.18. but he can make it hurtful to a man, he can command a ſerpent and he ſhall bite a man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he can hiſs for the flye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. There is a double exerciſe of providence, or the providence of God has two parts.

(2) He doth order their actions at his pleaſure; all of them ſhall accompliſh his ends; either he doth act them, or he doth ſuſpend their actions at his pleaſure; and if he will concur with them, or if he will withdraw his concurrence, it is all according to his pleaſure; and therefore he is the <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> and all the motions of this great Army are at his command; as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid to <hi>Joſeph, Without thee ſhall no man lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.</hi> It is true, that the Lord governs all things, yea the very thoughts of the heart, there doth not a motion ariſe but he doth faſhion the hearts of men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.15. <hi>Zac.</hi> 12.1. he formeth the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of men within them, ſo that what faſhion he doth put upon the apprehenſions of men; or the affections of men, the ſame they have; for all is of his government;<note place="margin">Ezech. 38.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. The Providence of God is either, (1) what he doth by his own hand immediately by an extraordinary providence; as ſometimes the Lord doth, ſo that it doth appear to be
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:52030:224"/> the finger of God, and that there is nothing of ſecond cauſes in it, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 52.10. his arm was made bare, and <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.9. his bow was made naked, both of them do ſignifie <hi>patefacta eſt potentia, Druſ.</hi> And ſo it appears when God goes out of the courſe of nature, as when cauſes have not their natural efficacies, the race is not to the ſwift, the battel is not to the ſtrong, the men of might cannot find their hands, <hi>the horſe and the rider is caſt into a deep ſleep, Pſal.</hi> 76.6. and ſo it is in all the Lords miraculous workings, when <hi>he doth create a new thing in the earth, and a woman doth compaſs a man, Jer.</hi> 31.22. he doth make the Sea to go back, and the Sun to ſtand ſtill, the Heavens to give bread, and the Rocks water, and all theſe extraordinary workings of God are for the good of his people; and that way he will work for them as their neceſſity ſhall require; for there is no ſuch thing that the Lord has done for his people formerly, but they may ſtill expect the ſame, if they be brought unto the ſame ſtraits and neceſſities,<note place="margin">Eſa. 10.24.</note>

                  <p n="4">4. The Providence of God is either ſeen (1) in things <hi>neceſſaria,</hi> which have a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary dependence upon their cauſes, and we may accordingly expect them; as the Sun and Moon to ſhine, or to be in their Eclipſe, as we ſay, <hi>It will be foul weather to day, for the skie is red, and it will be fair to morrow, for the skie is red,</hi> which men do conclude of by their obſervation, becauſe they have a neceſſary dependence upon their cauſes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.2, 3. And as it is in <hi>natural</hi> things, ſo it is in <hi>morals</hi> alſo, there are ſigns of the times, by which things may be as well known, and as certainly concluded by an obſerving man: a man may as well know the ſigns of the times, as the Stork and the Crane and the Swallow know their times, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.7, 8. or elſe why ſhould they be blamed for it, as being more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for themſelves than the brute creatures are, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (2) There are ſome things that are <hi>accidentalia,</hi> that are caſual or fall out ſo as we can give no reaſon for them; there is no expectation of it in man, as the diſpoſing of the minds of men, <hi>the Kings heart is in the hand of the Lord, Prov.</hi> 21.1. as in King <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> in the buſineſs of <hi>Mordecai,</hi> there was a concurrence of many things that were caſual; and ſo <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.33. <hi>The lot is caſt into the lap, but the whole diſpoſing of it is from the Lord:</hi> ſo that there is not the moſt caſual thing that can be, but it comes under a providence; and in all theſe alſo it is for the good of the Saints: as it's ſaid, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.22. a rumour <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> Army ſhall hear, they ſhall have ſuch an apprehenſion, that becauſe the Sun ſhines upon the water, therefore the Kings have ſlain one another, for this is blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Providence is either <hi>circa bonum vel malum,</hi> either (1) in all good, ſo the Lord doth work and order the ſpirits of men; for as every good gift is from above, ſo every good work is from him that is the Father of lights, and the Fountain of all goodneſs. (2) Alſo of all the evil that is in man there is a providence; for God would never have ſuffered ſin to have come into the world, if he had not known how to have wrought his own ends by it; even by the veſſels of diſhonour he is ſerved in his houſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.21. he doth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and over-rule even the ſins of men unto his own high and moſt glorious ends; he doth uphold <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and let out his ſpirit, but it is that he might ſhew his power in him: <hi>Even the wrath of man ſhall praiſe him; and the remainder he will and doth reſtrain:</hi> and <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.3. <hi>I kept thee that thou ſhouldſt not touch her.</hi> There is a letting out of ſin, and there is a reſtraint upon ſin, ſo far as it may ſerve to his ends. Now all the providence of God, whether it be for good or ill, either permitting or diſpoſing, it is all of it for the good of the Saints.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Providence of God is <hi>circa maxima,</hi> and that is for the good of the Saints, and this I will reduce unto two heads. (1) His government over the Angels. (2) Over men in all the great turnings and changes in the world, in the policies and in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:52030:224"/> thereof, for it is the moſt High rules in the Kingdoms of mortal men, and all this is done for the Saints ſake, and all is ordered ſo as it ſhall be for their good.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the government of the Angels either good, or bad, it's all for the good of the Saints.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As for the good Angels, it's true they are part of the ſpiritual Kingdom, and ſhall make up part of that great Church and body of which Chriſt is the head; and therefore <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22. we are ſaid to be come unto them; and therefore it is ordinary with the Fathers and the School-men (as I told you) to intimate, that there are as many men elected as there were Angels that fell, and that they are taken in to fill up that number, <hi>qui locum illum ſupplerent, &amp; ruinas Jeruſalem reſtaurarent, Bern.</hi> But they are alſo uſed by the Lord in the providential Kingdom, and all is for the Saints good in their whole Miniſtry; it is for the ſake of them that are <hi>heirs of ſalvation, Heb.</hi> 1.14. And <hi>Ezech.</hi> 1.5, &amp;c.<note place="margin">Ezech. 1.5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> we have the manner how the Lord governs all things in a threefold ſubordination; there are the <hi>wheels</hi> and the <hi>living creatures</hi> that act them, and <hi>one as the Son of man,</hi> by whoſe command and by whoſe Spirit they do move in all their ways, and the wheels by them.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) They do by a ſecret virtue work upon and over-rule the hearts and the wills of men; and therefore the Trumpets and the Vials are given unto the hands of Angels, that is, they do faſhion the hearts of men and ſtir up their ſpirits unto ſuch a work, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then their hearts in it; for as the Devil doth faſhion the minds and wills of men, and gives ſuggeſtions ſuitable to his deſigns, ſo do the good Angels alſo; and as Satan ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens the reſolution of wicked men, ſo do the good Angels alſo; for they have a power upon the ſoul alſo being Spirits, and a more immediate work upon the minds of men, as <hi>Ahabs</hi> falſe Prophets, <hi>thou ſhalt perſwade them</hi> and prevail; there is an impreſſion upon their hearts, they have their arguments and ſuggeſtions, and they follow them with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, till the men be overcome; ſo do the good Angels alſo:<note place="margin">Rev. 2.10.</note> 
                     <hi>the devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into priſon;</hi> it's Satans working powerfully in his inſtruments and upon the hearts of men to bring ſuch a deſign to paſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">(2) They fight for them againſt their enemies, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.20. <hi>I return and fight againſt the King of Perſia, and when I am gone forth,</hi> &amp;c. the Lord goes forth before a people, for they go forth under the conduct of the Angels, and they do oppoſe themſelves in a ſecret way that we know not: now as it is ſometimes a terror to the Saints to conſider they fight not againſt fleſh and blood, but againſt ſpiritual wickedneſs, ſo it is a mighty terror unto wicked men that they fight againſt principalities and powers, and ſpiritual holineſs in heavenly places, thoſe that will be ſure to watch over you for evil; for the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention that the Angels had after the Fall with a flaming ſword to keep man out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, the ſame intention they bear ſtill to all that are not the members of Chriſt and of the ſame body with them, and fellow-ſervants with them.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) They do execute vengeance upon the enemies of the Saints: <hi>Zac.</hi> 6.6, 7. there are <hi>black Horſes,</hi> inſtruments of vengeance, and they go forth into <hi>Perſia,</hi> but it is to deſtroy them, and to execute upon them the vengeance of the Temple for all the wrong that they had done unto the Saints, all was by an inviſible virtue that they ſaw not; there the Spirit of God was diſpleaſed, and would not be pacified till wrath was executed upon them; <hi>for the ſame Spirit orders the Kingdom of Providence that doth order the Kingdom of Grace,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore they have their ſpecial charge, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 9.1. it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors of the city that draw near, firſt the Angels came, and then the inſtruments of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance came, they do perform that great work upon them.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4) The Angels over-rule the creatures for the good of the Saints, even beyond their nature, and they are very inſtrumental in their deliverance and preſervation; as we ſee <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.28. the fire cannot burn, the Lord ſent his Angel, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.22. and ſtopped the Lions mouths; there is a ſecret work that Angels have in all theſe great things, for the Saints deliverance and preſervation; and therefore it is the Angel that rowls away the ſtone from Chriſts grave, and it's an Angel opens the priſon for <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 12. The pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Saints do prevail with God, and he commands Angels to do their office; it was an Angel that ſaid unto the Chriſtians at <hi>Jeruſalem, Ite ad Pellam,</hi> and by that means they were preſerved in the deſtruction of the City; ſo that in the ordering of all things they are imployed by God for the good of the Saints.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5) It is the Angels that guide them in their way, and ſucceed their buſineſs and all their undertakings, as we ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.7. <hi>The Lord of Heaven which brought me out of my fathers houſe, he ſhall ſend his Angel before thee;</hi> and the buſineſs ſhall ſurely proſper that they do undertake; a godly man goes no where without ſuch a guard for his protection, and without ſuch an aſſiſtance; and therefore it was a certain argument, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. <hi>ult.</hi> that the King of <hi>Grecia</hi> ſhould proſper, becauſe the Angel was gone out before him;
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:52030:225"/> bleſſed is he that hath ſuch a guide, <hi>he ſhall not daſh his foot againſt any ſtone,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, They do compaſs the earth, viſit all the parts of it for the Saints ſake, to ſee how it is with the Churches, <hi>Zac.</hi> 1. <hi>All the earth is quiet and ſtill;</hi> as the Devils do, ſo do the Angels alſo compaſs the earth, and they do lie in ambuſh for the Saints, that when there is no eye to pity them, and there is no remedy or relief for them, then they do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, <hi>Zac.</hi> 1.8. <hi>They are behind the myrtle-trees, in the bottom, and they do watch the fitteſt ſeaſon for the deliverance of the Saints, which is when they are loweſt, and when their enemies are higheſt, then they do appear for them:</hi> therefore the people of God that have ſuch a guard ſtill near at hand, that hath been ſo ſucceſsful in all ages, need not fear what Satan and his Angels are continually plotting againſt them.</p>
                  <p n="2">§. 2. We now proceed unto thoſe <hi>arcana imperii</hi> in reference to the Providence of God in the government of the evil Angels, and this alſo is for the good of the Saints; the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of God over the Devils in his government of them is wholly for the ſake and for the good of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>In the opening of this I will lay down theſe Concluſions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That Satan hath a power over all mankind by nature to rule and order them according to the pleaſure of his own will; for when man at firſt did freely ſubject himſelf unto the Devil, God did judicially give him up into the power of the Devil;</hi> and therefore 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. they are ſaid <hi>to be led captive by him at his will;</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. they are ſaid to lye <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>in the wicked one,</hi> that is, to be under his power, and to be ſubjected unto his will, and it is juſt with God ſo to do, <hi>Illud appenſum eſt aequitatis examine, ut nec ipſius diaboli poteſtati ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garetur homo, quem ſibi malè ſuadendo ſubjecerat,</hi> Auſt. <hi>For of whom a man is overcome, unto him he is brought into bondage;</hi> it's the manner of Conquerors to uſe men as ſlaves, whom they have ſubdued; and this was the Devils intent, not firſt to deſtroy men, but <hi>to take them alive,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.26. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>that he might uſe them for ſervice,</hi> and ſo rule over them; yet the meaning is not, as if he had received a commiſſion from God; and the Lord had commanded Satan to rule over man; for he will ſurely judge the Devil for it at the laſt day, <hi>Non ità debet intelligi, tanquam hoc Deus fecerit, aut fieri juſſerit, ſed quòd tantùm permiſerit, juſtè tamen, Auſt. Tom</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 295. The command unto <hi>Ahabs</hi> falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets was not a <hi>commiſſion</hi> from God, but a <hi>permiſſion, Thou ſhalt perſwade him and prevail,</hi> go forth and do ſo, and his going into the herd of ſwine was not a commiſſion, but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion only, when he ſaid unto them, Go, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> like unto that of <hi>Balaam, Go with the men,</hi> and yet the Lord was angry becauſe he went, ſo it is here alſo.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>This power of Satan is very great;</hi> and therefore he is called <hi>Principalities</hi> and <hi>Powers, the Ruler of the darkneſs of this world,</hi> yea, he hath the power of a God, for he is ſaid to be <hi>the God of this world,</hi> which doth ſet forth a high condition, not the higheſt power, <hi>credo poſſe occidere in una hora quemcun<expan>

                        </expan> in terra viventem, Luth.</hi> for the power that Satan hath is from God, and that in juſt judgment. Now if the Lord give ſo much power to a man, as he did to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> that none could ſtand before him, but he was the hammer of the whole earth, and yet the Lord did it in judgment, as he was an inſtrument in his hand, he did gather the riches of the Nations as eggs, none opened their mouth, or peep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt him; how much more unto him that God hath in judgment made the god of this world will the Lord permit ſuch power? <hi>Omnis voluntas díaboli ſemper eſt injuſta, ſed tamen Deo permittente juſta eſt poteſtas, Bern.</hi> The Devils will is of himſelf, but his power is of God, and therefore he is mighty.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The malice which doth ſet his power on work, though it be againſt all mankind, yet it is ſpecially againſt the Saints.</hi> It is true indeed, that it is againſt all mankind, and therefore his great labour is to draw all men to be partakers with him in the ſame ſin and the ſame torments, it is <hi>the fire that is prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> that they may all of them be caſt into the ſame Lake; and though he know it will but increaſe his own torment, yet there is this power of envy in him, that he will deſtroy them, though it tend ſo much the more unto his own hurt in the end: but his malice is in a ſpecial manner againſt the Saints, the ſpiritual combate is mainly between the ſeed of the woman and of the ſerpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. it is againſt <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.8, 9. But why is Satan ſo much againſt the Saints above all men in the world? (1) Becauſe God hath ſet his love upon them, therefore Satan hath ſet his malice againſt them. (2) They are the members of Chriſt, whom above all he doth hate, as having a Kingdom ſet up of purpoſe to deſtroy his Kingdom. (3) As they bear the image of God, and carrying thereby the greateſt treaſury within them; for as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> hath well obſerved, Satan is as a thief, he will not come to rob where nothing is to be had, but where the treaſure is, he will not rob ſtones and ſtraws, but Jewes. (4) They conquer him; for it is out of them that he is caſt out, which he looked upon as his houſe, as his own portion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.44. (5) They

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>There is amongst the Devils a kind of policy and order in carrying on of this deſign;</hi> ſo that, though there be no love in them one to another, for that is not amongſt the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Hell, all natural affection ceaſes there; yet there is a kind of faithfulneſs, they being by the ſame ſinful principles carried on unto the ſame end; and therefore there is a Prince of Devils, there is a kind of government amongſt themſelves in tendency to the deep de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns which they are to proſecute; not but that they were all of the ſame nature, but the ſame God who in judgment ſubjected mankind to his power, he giving up himſelf, hath ſubjected the Devils alſo unto the power of him that was the chief of Devils, and was firſt in the tranſgreſſion; that they have a kind of order amongſt themſelves to carry on their ends; there are the gates of Hell which ſome do interpret the Counſels of it, there are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and methods and devices amongſt them, and therefore <hi>Luther</hi> hath obſerved it: <hi>Diaboli regnum &amp; politiam inter ſe habent uſ<expan>

The Church of God is compared to a <hi>great houſe,</hi> and there are ſome veſſels to honour, and ſome to diſhonour, but they are all of them for the maſters uſe, and for the uſe of the houſe; and therefore we ſee, when the ſons of God come together, Satan himſelf alſo appears before God,<note place="margin">Job 1.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Job</hi> 1.6. partly being over-ruled by the power of God as a creature, and partly being inclined by his own malice as an executioner, he is deſirous to be imployed by God as a veſſel of diſhonour, as being one that hath <hi>mortis imperium, the power of death,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore he cannot deceive <hi>Ahabs</hi> Prophets without leave, nor can he enter into the herd of ſwine without leave, neither can he poſſeſs the man that had the Legion when the Lord Jeſus will caſt him out; his authority is limited, and though he be never ſo high and exalted up to heaven, yet he doth fall from heaven as lightning, if the Lord command it; and ſo he cannot deal with <hi>Job</hi> till the Lord permit him, and he cannot move beyond the bounds of his permiſſion, <hi>Diabolo poteſtas quaedam eſt, plerun<expan>

(2) Sometimes in juſt judgment God doth it, when his people ſin againſt him, and depart from him, the Lord doth leave them in the hand of the Devil as a priſoner, that he may correct them, and ſo recover them; as a father leaves his child in the hand of a ſervant to correct, ſo as he ſtands by and ſets the meaſure to it, he ſhall but correct him in meaſure, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. <hi>He will caſt them into priſon for ten days,</hi> as he did <hi>Paul,</hi> he was buffetted by Satan to prevent ſin, he did leave him to correct his ſin. (3) In an ordinance of Excommunication, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. being delivered to Satan he doth exerciſe tyranny over him to ſtir up the guilt of ſin within him, and to torment his conſcience, and God departs from him in point of comfort; for 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. it was, that he might not be ſwallowed up with over-much ſorrow, therefore it is ſorrow that is the fruit of this Ordinance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

There are two things that the power of Satan is wholly exerciſed in, temptation and affliction. (1) He is a Tempter in us, and that both as he is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. Satan doth plead againſt them before God and before men, and in their own conſciences alſo, ſtirring up of guilt in them alſo, and he hath his acceſſes unto Heaven, and he doth put up his deſires unto God againſt us, and doth lay our ſins unto our charge before the Throne of Juſtice, and demands juſtice againſt us;<note place="margin">Zac. 3.1, 2.</note> for <hi>Zac.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>Satan ſtands at his right hand,</hi> which was to accuſe, for the Accuſer ſtood at the right hand; and it was to reſiſt him, the right hand being chiefly the inſtrument of action, therefore it was to hinder him in the great ſervice that he was now about to do, and to object againſt him before the Lord his filthy garment with which he was cloathed at his appearance before the Lord. Now both theſe, the temptations and the accuſations of Satan, the Soveraignty of God doth rule and over-rule for the ſpiritual good of the Saints, which I ſhall make appear in theſe particulars; and therefore <hi>Bernard</hi> calls him <hi>Malleus terrae,</hi> and he ſaith, <hi>Terit electos in utilitatem, &amp; reprobos conterit in damnatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, pag.</hi> 300.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is a reſtraint upon him, that he ſhall tempt them no more than is for their good: <hi>He will not ſuffer us to be tempted above what we are able,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. It is true, that Satan is ſubtle in his temptations, and he doth take a meaſure of the ſpirits of men, that ſo he may proportion his temptations unto them; ſome ſpirits are too low for ſome temptations, as their underſtandings are for ſome opinions. Now Satan therefore doth not ſuggeſt ſuch depths unto them, but deals with them in a lower way; but there are ſome temptations that would not take with ſome, becauſe their ſpirits and their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings are above them, and he deals with them in a higher and in a more ingenious way. Now as Satan doth take a meaſure of the ſpirits of men in every temptation, ſo doth God alſo take a meaſure of their grace, that it ſhall be ſo much, and no more; for there are ſome temptations that the grace that is in ſome men could not bear, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord doth proportion it in wiſdom and in mercy: it is true, unto wicked men it is otherwiſe, there is a power that is beyond the ſtrength of the common works that are upon them, an opportunity of temptation that turns them off as leaves that are ſhaken with the wind; but it is not ſo with the Saints: <hi>Ad menſuram permittitur tentare Diabolus; ſed qui dat Tentatori poteſtatem, ipſe tantato praebet miſericordiam, Auguſt. tom.</hi> 8. <hi>p.</hi> 435.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Satan ſhall tempt no further than it ſhall be for the ſubduing of corruption: men are delivered unto Satan for the deſtruction of the fleſh; but it is an over-ruling hand of the Soveraignty of God, who doth temper ſuch poyſon into a wholeſom medicine, and what the enemy did intend ſhould kill, that ſhall be a means to cure. And therefore <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> doth deride the Papiſts in this, who having ſpoken in his Covent unto one of the Society of a Purgatory, and they objected it againſt him, that he did grant in his writings a Purgatory alſo, he anſwers them, <hi>That he doth grant a Purgatory, but it is this of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only,</hi> by which the Lord is pleaſed to purge the ſouls of his people, and that makes them to come out the more refined, <hi>hoc Purgatorium fictum non eſt, &amp;c.</hi> Great hath been the gain that the people of God have had by their temptations this way, yea even by thoſe temptations in which they have been foiled: <hi>Neſcit Diabolus quomodo illo inſidiante &amp; furente utatur ad ſalutem fidelium excellentiſſima Dei ſapientia, &amp;c. Aug. tom.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 218.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It doth mightily improve their graces; we ſee it in <hi>Job,</hi> we know what the end was that God made with him; as all afflictions improve graces, and make the land fruitful, as the rain doth, though it make the way foul, ſo there is not a greater affliction than tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, for a man to be left to be as the ſink into which the Devil ſhall empty all the filthineſs that is in that unclean ſpirit; therefore this alſo ſhall turn into the increaſe of grace: wherefore <hi>Luther</hi>'s ſaying, <hi>That there are three things make a Divine, Meditation, Oration, and Tentation,</hi> is moſt true, for grace oppoſed is much improved; a ſoul had never ſeen ſuch high acts of grace, had it not met with ſuch high oppoſition. It's true, in it ſelf it doth not increaſe grace, for it is oppoſite unto it, but by an Antiperiſtaſis it doth, <hi>debemus eſſe Dialectici, non pugnamus ut homines, ſed ut Chriſtiani, Luth.</hi> and therefore the Spirit of Chriſt will improve his own work in us by our temptations alſo.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We have by this, experience of the power of Chriſt in us. Experimental knowledge is a knowledge upon tryal, and ſuch a knowledge a man can never have till he be brought unto a tryal; there is many a man that doth preſumptuouſly think that he can do much,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:52030:226"/> and reſiſt much, but when he comes to the tryal he is weak as water, and it's all but the vain preſumption of his own ſpirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee, my ſtrength ſhall be perfected,</hi> that is, ſhall be declared to be perfect, in weakneſs; therefore <hi>I take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in infirmities, for when I am weak, then am I ſtrong:</hi> it is an eaſie thing for the potſherds to contend with the potſherds of the earth, but when we come to contend with Spirts, and they ſtrengthned by the darkneſs that is within us, now the ſtrength of grace is put to it indeed, now we ſee what power of Chriſt is in us; for there is no power but Chriſts power that can hold out againſt temptation.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That we may know the benefit of Chriſts Interceſſion, that having ſo great an Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer as Satan is, we may go to him, and ſtrive to find the benefit of ſuch an Advocate. O what an advantage was it to <hi>Peter</hi> to hear this ſweet word of Chriſt to him! <hi>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.</hi> Chriſt was tempted in all things like unto us, and he is ſenſible of our infirmities, and with the temptation we ſhall find a way to eſcape; for this very end Chriſt ſuffered himſelf to be tempted by Satan, that he might ſuccour us in all our temptations, he is pleading for us againſt the accuſations of our ſubtle adverſaries, and if he had not undertaken to be our Advocate, we had been undone, but he ſtill ſaith to Satan, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And truly hereby we have experience of the power of our own prayers; how many times have the prayers of a Saint <hi>ſtilled the enemy and the avenger</hi> that purſued them furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly? how many times hath Satan fall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; and it's a great honour to the Saints, that in their conqueſts they can overcome Satan; for <hi>reſiſt the Devil, and he will flye from you;</hi> that ſo proud a Spirit ſhould be ſo ſubdued by mankind, <hi>in fide fortes Diabolum deſpiciunt quaſi vermiculum, &amp;c.</hi> Bern. pag. 1309. <hi>cùm viderint contemnunt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. It quickens the people of God to wiſdom and watchfulneſs; to wiſdom, that they may diſcern the devices of Satan; and to watchfulneſs, as the exhortation is, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Watch therefore and put on the whole armour of God, becauſe he is as a roaring lyon ſeeking whom he may devour. Auſtin</hi> obſerves, that there are two ways that Satan hath. (1) In times of perſecution, <hi>cogit Chriſtianos negare Chriſtum, he compels Chriſtians to deny Chriſt.</hi> (2) In times of peace and proſperity he raiſeth up Hereticks, and ſo <hi>docet Chriſtianos Chriſtum ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare, teaches Chriſtians to deny Chriſt, Tom.</hi> 8. <hi>pag.</hi> 233. therefore we had need be wiſe and watchful.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. There is a time coming when this over-ruling power of Chriſt will put an end unto this dominion of Satan; he ſhall not be the god of this world always, but when Chriſt puts down all rule and all authority and power, his Kingdom will for ever be broken, it muſt laſt no longer than the day of Judgment, for there will be no further uſe of him either in tempting, accuſing, or tormenting; but as after the day of Judgment Chriſt in glory ſhall make up the head of that great body the Church which ſhall be gathered unto glory by him, as they were here on earth gathered into his Kingdom of Grace; ſo Satan in Hell alſo ſhall make up the head of that great body of the wicked that he hath been gathering into his Kingdom here upon earth, and he ſhall be tormented together with them: and it is no ſmall comfort, that we can look beyond the power of the enemies; though they be ſo powerful for the preſent, it is but for a while; <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had power to do what he pleaſed in the world, but after a little while this great Monarch ſhall be deſtroyed, <hi>My anger,</hi> ſays the Lord, <hi>ſhall ceaſe in his deſtruction,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The temptations and accuſations of Satan ſhall tend to the greater increaſe of the glory of the Saints; for if theſe light afflictions that all Saints meet with in the world from leſſer evils do work for us, much more will ſuch great afflictions, <hi>Poteſt inimicus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citare tentationis motum, ſed quoties reſtiteris, toties coronaberis, Bern. p.</hi> 11, 15. They had their ſeveral Crowns in their Triumph anſwerable unto the ſeveral Victories that they won; therefore Chriſt hath upon his head many Crowns, becauſe of his many Conqueſts: ſo it ſhall be unto the Saints matter of great triumph; Satan himſelf who did above all things deſire to keep them from glory, his very temptations and his accuſations ſhall be ſo far uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as that they ſhall add unto our glory, and they that have been moſt tempted and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by him, and have by grace reſiſted him, ſhall be moſt glorified in the day of the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="3">§. 3. The next thing propounded was Gods providential Kingdom, as it reſpects men, and theſe either good or bad, which belong both unto the providential Kingdom; and the Soveraignty of God over them is laid out wholly for the good of the Saints. And here firſt we are to conſider Providence ordering all things either in reference unto the Saints own ſpiritual good, that the ordering of all things towards them ſhall tend unto it;
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:52030:227"/> or elſe in reference unto the good of others; Providence ſhall ſo order things, that they ſhall become a common and a publick good unto others in the generations in which they live, yea and it ſhall extend alſo unto after-ages.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Providence ſhall ſo diſpoſe of all things, as they ſhall tend unto their own ſpiritual good; and all by reaſon of their intereſt in the Soveraignty and the Supremacy of God, as, 1. If we look upon their converſion, Providence doth ſtrangely order things ſo, that they ſhall be caſt upon ſuch ſocieties and opportunities, which they never thought of nor lookt after; and in theſe they ſhall be converted and brought home unto God: there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in <hi>Oneſimus,</hi>

And ſo it was with <hi>Junius,</hi> his father laying the Scripture before him,<note place="margin">Joh. 1.1.</note> he fell occaſionally and careleſly upon <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning was the word,</hi> &amp;c. he was ſo taken with the majeſty of the ſtile, and with the excellency of the matter, that he did not know where he was, nor what he did, it did ſo far excel all humane writings. And truly there are few men converted but they will be able to tell you ſome ſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, as well as the ſpecial grace of God therein, bringing them into ſuch ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and caſting them upon ſuch occaſions, ſometimes in their callings, and ſometimes even in a way of ſin; <hi>he being found of them that ſought him not, and pleaſed to bring them out of darkneſs into his marvellous light:</hi> and when men ſhall come to Heaven, infinite will the praiſes be, not only of grace, but of his Soveraignty this way, to ſet forth what great variety the Lord hath uſed, and what marvellous wiſdom he hath exerciſed towards his people in bringing them home unto him; for as there are <hi>inſnaring providences,</hi> ſo there are alſo <hi>converting providences;</hi> the one befal wicked men, and are exerciſed towards them, and the other befal thoſe that are the people of his good will. As we ſee <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.26. there is a woman <hi>whoſe hands are ſnares and bands:</hi> all men do not light upon ſuch providences, God doth not caſt them upon them; there is no man that doth ſcape theſe ſnares by his own wiſdom, but it is the man that is good before God, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>he that the Lord hath a delight in,</hi> that ſhall be delivered from ſuch a one, but the ſinner ſhall be taken with her, providence ſhall ſo order it, that he ſhall have ſuch occaſions, opportunities, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, that he ſhall be inſnared. And ſo it is in <hi>converting providences,</hi> he ſhall be caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch company, time, places, and opportunities that ſhall be effectual to his converſion; ſo many a man is able to ſay, God brought me in the Univerſity unto ſuch a Tutor, into ſuch company, and into ſuch a family, and under ſuch a miniſtry, and by this in an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected way was I wrought upon; and ſome have come to hear a Miniſter by chance, in a journey, and have been ſmitten, <hi>haerebat lateri,</hi> have carried home a wound in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; and when with <hi>Saul</hi> they did but go to ſeek Aſſes, they have found a Kingdom: ſome, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> did <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> go to hear a man for his elegancy of ſtile; and as <hi>Galeacius Caracciola</hi> did <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and they, together with the excellency of his words, felt a warmth and power in their hearts, a fire was kindled that they never could put out again. Some have come to ſee the ſufferings of the Chriſtians, and thereat were converted, and at the ſight of their patience cryed out, <hi>Verè magnus eſt Deus Chriſtianorum, The God of the Chriſtians is truly great;</hi> and ſome by the ſight of an affliction, as <hi>Waldus</hi> by ſeeing a man to fall down dead before him; and ſome that have come to hear Miniſters only to mock at them, and yet have before their departure been taken by them. Very ſtrange are the over-rulings of Providence for the converſion of the Saints, when all their experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall be laid together this way: but there are two famous inſtances of over-ruling Providence, one in <hi>Vergerius</hi> a Biſhop of <hi>Juſtinople,</hi> of whom <hi>Sleidan</hi> reports, that being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed as a Legate by the Pope in <hi>Germany,</hi> was ſuſpected to lean too much unto the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans opinion, and therefore had not favour with the Pope as he expected; at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn he intended to clear himſelf, and to write a Book in the refutation of the Lutheran opinions; and by that means looking more narrowly into them, he was truly converted, and left his Biſhoprick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the other is of famous Doctor <hi>Reynolds,</hi> who was formerly a Papiſt and his Brother a Proteſtant, and they wrote to convert one another, and it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Lord ſo to order it, that his Brother by him was converted to Popery, and died a Papiſt, to whom he wrote much afterwards to reclaim him; and he was converted from Popery, and died a Proteſtant, and proved a famous and an eminent inſtrument in the Church of God for the beating down of Popery all his days; and he had not any thing ſtuck more upon him, than that he was an inſtrument in the perverting of his Brother, by whom he himſelf had received ſo much good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not only for their Converſion, but for their Inſtruction: the people of God have
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:52030:227"/> met with ſtrange providences. We ſee it in <hi>Apollos, Act.</hi> 18. <hi>Claudius</hi> commands all Jews to depart from <hi>Rome,</hi> and thereupon <hi>Aquila</hi> and his wife depart and came to <hi>Corinth,</hi> and there <hi>Paul</hi> finds them, and being of the ſame trade they wrought together, and they travel with him to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and there he leaves them, and there came <hi>Apollos</hi> a Jew unto <hi>Epheſus,</hi> a man that was mighty in the Scriptures, and they took him and inſtructed him in the way of God more perfectly; all this concurrence of providence there is for his inſtruction. So <hi>Luther,</hi> as ſoon as the Lord had revealed the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to him to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for Juſtification, immediately he fell upon <hi>Auſtins</hi> Book, <hi>De Spiritu &amp; Litera,</hi> and there he finds the word <hi>juſtitia</hi> commonly ſo uſed, <hi>non de juſtitia puniente, not of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Juſtice</hi> of God, but of his pardoning Righteouſneſs, that is, the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt for which God would pardon the ſins of his people.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For deliverance out of danger; as we ſee in the inſtance of <hi>Moſes,</hi> it was Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that brought out <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter to the place where he lay in an Ark of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſhes; and it muſt be by a dream that <hi>Joſeph</hi> is to be delivered out of priſon; and ſo <hi>David</hi> being beſieged, and not knowing how to eſcape, when he thought that he was now in the mouth of the Lion, news was brought unto <hi>Saul</hi> that ſought his life, that the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtins</hi> had invaded the land, and he returned from ſeeking after <hi>David;</hi> and ſo <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> it was told him by the Prophet, <hi>that Sennacherib ſhould hear a rumour,</hi> &amp;c. for it was told him that the King of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> had invaded the land, and ſo he raiſed the ſiege and departed from <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The Lord knows how to deliver his children in the time of their greateſt extremity, and the God that hath delivered, doth ſtill deliver his people, and is a God near at hand and not afar off from them that wait for him.</p>

For their conſolation; when the day hath been dark over them, and their ſouls have drawn near to the grave, and their life to the deſtroyers, the Lord hath cauſed light to ſhine out of darkneſs, and hath made their light to break forth out of obſcurity; and when they have walked in the ſhadow of death, a light hath riſen upon them; as the Martyr that was in priſon in his own ſpirit till he came into priſon, and the priſon was that which the Lord made uſe of for his enlargement, <hi>Schola crucis, lucis feneſtra:</hi> and ſo we read of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Martyr, who upon this ground did wonderfully bleſs God that he came into priſon, that thereby he became acquainted with that Angel of God <hi>John Bradford.</hi> The providence of God is as wonderful in the conſolations as in the converſion of his people; for it is a creating of the <hi>fruit of the lips</hi> peace, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 57.19. and that is <hi>ex nihilo.</hi>

                  <p n="6">6. In temptations; when the luſt hath been high, and the temptation impetuous, and the man about to yield, the Lord hath ſometimes appeared and ſtruck the luſt as it were from Heaven immediately, and ſaid, Stay thy hand, and the luſt hath vaniſhed (for the faſhion of the world paſſeth away, and the luſt thereof) that a mans heart hath been dead unto that which before it was with the greateſt violence ſet upon; the Lord hath <hi>hedged up a mans way with thorns, ſo that he could not ſin with ſecurity,</hi> as other men do,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 2.6, 7.</note> but ſtill when he would have ſinned there were ſtumbling-blocks in his way, and ſome providences that did concur to croſs him in a way of ſinning, and ſome to pull him out of the fire when he was falling in; as the inſtance of <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a ſpecial Providence over godly men for the good of others that are good in their preſent and in after-generations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is a ſtrange Providence in improving their parts; <hi>Moſes</hi> being to be a man of great imployment for the good of the people of God, he muſt be <hi>learned in all the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Egyptians;</hi> and ſo the parts of <hi>Auſtin</hi> and his learning, and ſo of <hi>Luther,</hi> how ſtrangely did God make uſe of for the good of his people! and <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.22.

                  <p n="2">2. In drawing out of their graces, as in <hi>Joſeph</hi> by the temptation of his miſtreſs, and the perſecution that he met with, <hi>his bow abode in ſtrength, and his arm was made ſtrong;</hi>
                     <pb n="412" facs="tcp:52030:228"/> and ſo it was with <hi>Job,</hi> that we might <hi>hear of his patience, and what end the Lord made with him;</hi> and we know how ſtrangely the Lord did order things, that the height of <hi>Luthers</hi> ſpirit did riſe by the oppoſition that was againſt him, that he that at firſt would have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of eaſie terms, afterwards reſolved that nothing but the utter overthrow of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery ſhould ſatisfie him: <hi>Efficiam ut Anathema ſit eſſe papiſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Their ſufferings; ſo it was with <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 50.20. <hi>Ye intended evil, but the Lord turned it unto good to ſave much people alive;</hi> it was your good that God intended in my affliction: and ſo <hi>Johns</hi> baniſhment into <hi>Patmos,</hi> it was that he might receive the Book of the Revelations, which hath been the great ſtay of the hearts and faith of the people of God ever ſince; and though it may be obſcure, yet <hi>Conrad.

                  <p n="5">5. Their labours; As 'tis ſaid, that <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote the Book of <hi>Job</hi> for the conſolation of the people of God, when they were in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and of what uſe hath that been in general to the Church of God ever ſince? ſo, many of the pains of the people of God in writing the lives of the godly, and the Sermons and ſayings of the Miniſters of God, and their own obſervations of the ſigns of the times, and whatever they have of that kind been put upon in particular caſes, providence hath ſo over-ruled things, that they have been as a ſtanding benefit unto the Church of God in after-ages; and they have lived when the men have died. There are many defences of the people of God and Apologies that they have been put upon in all ages, when men of corrupt minds have aſperſed the writings and perſons of thoſe that have been eminent in their places for aſſerting the <hi>Truths of God,</hi> and witneſſing againſt the corruptions of the times, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Not only their labours have been very uſeful in all ages, but alſo their Examples of well-doing. Povidence doth put the Saints upon many things and conditions, that they may leave their example as monuments in the ages to come, as the Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.14. <hi>By my bonds many of the brethren wax confident,</hi> are much more bold to ſpeak the truth without fear; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Be thou an example of the believers in word, in converſation, in charity, in ſpirit, in faith, and in purity:</hi> they muſt be exemplary in every generation, that they may leave their footſteps behind them, that the people of God may walk after them, and go forth by the footſteps of the ſtock in after-ages; and that they may be ſo, the Lord doth in his providence ſo order things, that they ſhall have occaſion to ſhew themſelves examples in all things; ſo that there is an over-ruling providence by virtue of the intereſt of the Saints in the Soveraignty of God that orders all things towards good men for their own good, and all providences over them for the good of his people in the preſent and in after-ages, that ſo a good man may be every way a common good.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. They have great advantages by the prayers of the Saints; for even the wicked of the age, yea and of after-ages do attain benefits by their prayers, much more do the Saints that are of the ſame body with themſelves; for they do none of them live barely as private men; though they are not all publick perſons in reſpect of office and function, yet they are in reſpect of their relation, and they have all of them reference unto the body, and they do pray as members of the body, and have in all things reſpect unto the good of the body; for as the Spirit that doth interpret the Scripture, is not a <hi>private Spirit,</hi> ſo the Spirit that doth act the Saints is not a private Spirit; therefore as in the good of every member the body is intereſſed, ſo alſo in the prayers of every one the body is intereſſed; therefore as we are to look upon all the prayers of Chriſt not as the prayers of a private man, but as put up by him who is the Churches Head, ſo we are alſo to look upon the prayers of all the Saints, not as of private men, but alſo as under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of memberſhip, under which they ſtand in the body of Chriſt; and as we are to look upon their ſufferings as being of the body, ſo are we alſo to look upon their ſervices as being done by the members of the ſame body, and all of them for the good and benefit of the body. <hi>Moſes</hi> obtained great benefits to the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by his prayers, their bleſſings depended much upon his prayers: <hi>Pardon them as thou haſt done it from Egypt till now;</hi> and the Lord anſwers, <hi>I have pardoned them according to thy word;</hi> and again <hi>Moſes</hi> prays, <hi>Go before them, or carry us not from hence;</hi> the Lord anſwers, <hi>My preſence ſhall go
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:52030:228"/> with you, and I will give you reſt.</hi> The bleſſings that godly men attain are not barely the fruit of their own prayers, and yet they that are godly do pray alſo, but they are a concurrence of prayers, and by them we do attain mercy; yea ſometimes when we are little able to pray for our ſelves, when the ſpirit of prayer is low in its actings in us, yet then the ſouls of ſome of the Saints are upon the wing, and the Lord will have reſpect unto them, for they are of the body. As we rejoice not in the gifts of others, becauſe we look upon them as given unto other men, and do not look upon them as a part of the body, and ſo ſee our intereſt in them, that they are given them for our good, and therefore they are to us ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter of envy than of rejoicing; ſo we take no comfort in the prayers of the Saints upon this ground, becauſe we look not upon them as praying upon the ſame common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt with us, and as praying for us as fellow-members, who have with them an equal intereſt in the good of the body and its proſperity. And as they obtain mercy, ſo they keep off judgment; if <hi>Noah, Daniel, and Job ſtood before me;</hi> he ſpeaks it as the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual way of prevailing with him, and as that which he would leaſt of all deny, and yet the Decree being gone forth, his heart could not be towards them. The Saints have in their ages attained great mercy for the body, and therefore <hi>Elijah</hi> is called <hi>the chariot of Iſrael and the horſe-men thereof,</hi> their main defence lay in him, under Heaven they had not ſo great a one: and therefore godly men in all ages have looked upon it as a great miſery for the godly of the age to be removed, as having their party and their intereſt upon earth weakned; as if an eminent man of any party be taken away, it's looked upon as a great weakning to them, and he is thereupon gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Wherefore it is repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as their ſin, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 57.1. <hi>That the righteous periſh, and no man layeth it to heart,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.1. it is expreſſed by the Prophet as a duty; and ſo it was with <hi>Auſtins</hi> mother, he ſaies of her, <hi>Orationibus vivebat,</hi> and it was in anſwer to her prayers that he was new-born unto God, <hi>Parturivit me, &amp; carne ut in hanc temporalem, &amp; corde ut in aeternam lucem renaſcerer,</hi> Tom. 9. cap. 8. <hi>She travailed with me, as in her fleſh to bring me forth to a temporal life, ſo in her heart to an eternal life:</hi> he was an eminent inſtrument in the Church in the age in which he lived, and mightily confuted the falſe Teachers of the time, and did glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly defend the truth, and appeared for it, and all this he did attain by the benefit of his mothers prayers. And they do bring upon the Churches enemies very great and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble judgments by their prayers; there is a fire that comes out of their mouths and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes their enemies, and that not as they are theirs, but as they are the Churches ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And not only the prayers of the preſent age ſhall have power againſt Antichriſt, but the prayers of the former ages; as to inſtance in the prayers of <hi>David</hi> taking place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Judas, Act.</hi> 1. ſo there have been prayers for many years that have been going for the Reformation of <hi>England</hi> from Popery, which have been anſwered eminently in our daies, and will be more and more anſwered in ſucceeding generations, <hi>the people of God pray continually for more degrees of grace and light.</hi> Now it's true, that when men ſtrike an Oak with many blows, yet it doth not fall till the laſt blow, and yet we ſay, that it is not the laſt blow that fells the Oak, but all that went before; ſo 'tis here, as it was in the death of Chriſt, his laſt act was the full payment, but yet all his former obedience and ſufferings did concur thereunto to all that full ſatisfaction that was given by him to the Father; and it's dreadful when the prayers of all the people of God do fall upon a man, ſurely vengeance will overtake him as an armed man. Look as all the prayers of the Saints do at the laſt day meet together in the Devils deſtruction; ſo it ſhall be in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of any great and eminent inſtrument of his; as in attaining ſpecial deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Lord ſtands upon number, ſo it is in bringing in eminent judgments alſo; and therefore <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſends for <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and tells him, <hi>That the children were come to the birth,</hi> the promiſes did travail with deliverance, <hi>but there was no ſtrength to bring forth,</hi> unleſs he would add his prayers alſo; and ſo it is with the people of God, it is much more to loſe one praying man than a plotting or a fighting man; and that is the meaning, that <hi>great Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon came into remembrance before God;</hi> how was it? it was from the Lords <hi>remembrancers,</hi> for the Vials did come out of the Temple, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.1. all their prayers met together,<note place="margin">Rev. 16.1.</note> and there is a full cry, that the Lord is put in remembrance, which by his long delay and forbearance he had ſeemed to neglect and forget.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. By their Faith the people of God attain much mercy to others as well as by their prayers; for as by their prayers they do not only attain mercy for themſelves, ſo they do not only by their faith attain mercy for themſelves: it is ſaid of the men that came to Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>That when he ſaw their faith, he ſaid to the ſick of the palſie, Son thy ſins are forgiven thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mark</hi> 2.5. There is a queſtion put by Interpreters, whether any man be ſaved by another mans faith, or what benefit a man may have by the faith of another? to which they commonly give this anſwer, That the faith of others may be very uſeful
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:52030:229"/> unto men, though they be ſinful, in reference unto temporal mercies and deliverance, as the Saints are ſaid <hi>by faith to ſubdue kingdoms, attain promiſes, ſtop the mouths of lyons; out of weakneſs were made ſtrong;</hi>

And therefore if by the faith of one many, even ungodly men, may fare the better, how much more may all the Saints (who are one body, and live not only for their own good, but alſo for the good one of another) by their faith attain very many temporal bleſſings one from another, and by the faith one of another? Yea they go further, though it's true that no man can be ſaved but by his own faith, and it was by this mans faith alſo laying hold upon pardon, that his ſins were forgiven him, yet <hi>ubi eſt mutuus fidei conſenſus ab aliis juvari aliorum ſalutem, Calv.</hi> The Lord, even in granting ſpiritual bleſſings to his people, hath as well reſpect unto the faith of others, as unto the prayers of others: as when we pray and others pray for us, the mercy is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a return unto both prayers; ſo when we believe, and others alſo do believe, the mercy is given with reſpect to the faith of both parties: and this is the bleſſed condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints, that they do not only attain temporal mercies one for another, and are the better in temporal things, but even in ſpiritual and eternal things they do attain mercy, as by their prayers, ſo by the faith one of another; as they may pray one for another, ſo they may alſo believe one for another; and the mercies be granted to them, ſo there be a concurrence alſo of the faith of the perſon that receives the mercy.

It is ordinary with us to deſire the prayers one of another, and by the ſame reaſon that we have an intereſt in the prayers of the faithful we have an intereſt in the faith of the faithful alſo; and we may as well deſire them to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and exerciſe their faith for us, as their prayers; and ſo did <hi>Monica</hi> for her ſon; and parents ſhould do it for their children as well as for their own ſouls; and ſo for our friends alſo. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaking of the former experiences that his mother had in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer and return of her prayers, ſaies of her, <hi>Semper orans tanquam chirographa tua in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerebat tibi, &amp;c.</hi> And truly the returns of the faith of the faithful would be as great (though they be not ſo commonly known) as the return of their prayers, and yet their prayers will avail nothing, if they be not the prayers of faith.</p>
                  <p n="4">§. 4. Thus we have ſpoken ſomething of the providential Kingdom in over-ruling all things for the good of the Saints in reference unto Good men; now follows that we ſpeak ſomething alſo in reference unto Evil men; for there is a Government and Soveraignty that the Lord doth alſo exerciſe towards them, and all for the good of his own people. Now the Lord Jeſus hath a rule and dominion not only over his own houſe, but alſo over the world; and <hi>he doth rule them with a rod of iron, Pſal.</hi> 2.9. and it is in this only that the people of God, when they look upon wicked men in the world, can comfort themſelves that the Lord reigns, and the power and the government of themſelves is not in their own hand, even the veſſels of diſhonour in his great houſe (whether we underſtand it of the Church or of the world) are for the maſters uſe, and at the maſters command; even wicked men as well as Devils, are not at their own diſpoſe, there is a government that he doth exerciſe over them, for he hath undertaken the government of all things for the good of his people, and for their ſake, and if he do adminiſter all for their good, he muſt rule their enemies in all things, as well as the Saints, that the people of God may ſay, <hi>That neither Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor any creature ſhall be able to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them from the love of God in Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 8.38. he orders all the motions of enemies as well as the motions of his people, as the Captain of the Lords Hoſt, and he orders all things ſo as it ſhall be for the deſtruction of the enemy at the laſt; for all things are put under his feet, the laſt enemy that is deſtroyed is death; therefore all is put under his government, and he doth rule them ſo, as that in their own actings they do find their own deſtruction; his government over them is that they might be deſtroyed, and in their own way find their deſtruction, but yet ſo as they ſhall be wholly ruled and ordered for the good of his people, and that will appear in theſe particulars.</p>

That Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe it is much urged now adays, as it hath been by ſome of the Anabaptiſts of old, againſt the power of the civil Magiſtrate in puniſhing groſs offenders, that all are to be left unto their liberty, and unto the judgment of the Lord at his coming, and therefore none are to be puniſhed nor reſtrained, which is the greateſt cruelty that can be under the pretence of liberty to go on in ſin without reſtraint; therefore it will be neceſſary that we inquire a little into it. (1) We will inquire of whom this is ſpoken: which I conceive to be of the Church, and not of all the world; for it is ſaid to be the Lords <hi>Field,</hi> where the good are ſown with the bad, which can be meant no where but in the Church, unleſs we will ſay, as many men do, that there is ſalvation amongſt the Heathens, that know not Chriſt.

                        <hi>Verſ.</hi> 24, 25.</note> the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> is the Church of Chriſt in its outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, neither do I conceive that it can be manifeſted, that any where the whole world is ever called the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> and the ſervants ſpeak of it with admiration, <hi>Thou didſt ſow good ſeed in thy field, from whence then hath it tares?</hi> Now never any man did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that there ſhould be tares in the world, which lies in wickedneſs: and for that Chriſt doth interpret the field to be the world, it is not to be underſtood (I conceive) of all the wide world, but by a figure for the Church that is gathered out of the world, as it is uſual in the Scripture to be put; <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Not only for us, but alſo for the ſins of the whole world.</hi> (2) The ſtate of this Church, this field of the Lord is in this life ſaid to be a mixed ſtate, there are tares and wheat mixed in it, which is not to be underſtood of all ſorts of ſinners; it is true it's the ſeed of the wicked one, but it is the ſeed that is in the Lords field where groſs offenders are not to be ſuffered or ſuppoſed to be; but it is ſpoken of Hypocrites, ſuch as the ſervants did not diſcern at firſt, but they grew up with the ſeed, and had a great like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with it, as <hi>Jerome</hi> obſerves, <hi>Zizania quamdiu herba eſt, grandis eſt ſimilitudo;</hi> for in <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. 'tis ſaid, <hi>When the blade was ſprung up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares;</hi> therefore it ſeems by this plainly, that the tares are not the ſame with briars and thorns, for they would have been at firſt diſcerned, but they were like unto the wheat for a great while, ſo that they diſcovered them not: therefore the ſeed of the wicked one ſown in the Lords field are Hypocrites and unſound-hearted men. And if this be meant of the whole world, as the oppoſite party would expound it, then it muſt be meant of all ſorts of ſinners in the world that appear; not only Hereticks and Idolaters, as they would have it, but of all the children of the wicked one, unleſs they will give unto theſe this ſpecial honour, which is indeed due unto them (as much as now they are pleaded for) that they are only or mainly called the children of the wicked one; and as they do deſerve that name above all ſorts of ſinners. (3) This mixture cannot be avoided by all the care of the Lords ſervants; for they cannot foreſee them, and it's long before they do diſcover them, and when they are diſcovered, it is dangerous to pluck them up. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, that Chriſt doth not here diſpute either the power of the Magiſtrate or of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or how they ſhould exerciſe their power; but only to free the weak from ſcandal, when in the Church they ſhall ſee Hypocrites and unſound-hearted men to continue; for this is and will be the ſtate of the Church of Chriſt in reference to its outward condition until the day of Judgment. But how comes it to paſs, that the ſinners muſt be reſtrained here only to Hereticks and Idolaters, when they are the children of the wicked one? and why not extended to murderers, and adulterers, and thieves? and why is not the one to be ſpared by this Parable as well as the other? and how comes it to paſs, that by the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants here are only to be meant the Magiſtrates, and not the Miniſters? and why are not Miniſters as well bound to tolerate theſe in Churches, as Magiſtrates in Common-wealths? and yet that they are to be caſt out of Churches, that is granted. Now why ſhould not theſe mixtures be let alone in the one as well as in the other? and why is not the direction given to one ſort of ſervants as well as the other? (4) It is for the Elects ſake, for the good ſeed, that they are ſpared. [1] There is a great deal of moderation
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:52030:230"/> to be uſed and care in reference unto the tares, that nothing be done unto them that may prejudice the good corn, that nothing be done in it to the offence or the ſcandal of them that be good, that they be offended with their rigour and bitter zeal. [2] Becauſe they that are tares now may afterwards become good corn, and therefore a great deal of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is to be exerciſed towards them, though they diſcover themſelves to be tares. [3] That though there be ſtill ſome that are unſound, yet a man ſhould not be offended, and caſt off all Church-communion and Ordinances, but be willing to let both grow together unto the harveſt, and expect the Lords time for the rooting of them all out, till he ſhall ſend his reapers, becauſe we cannot fully diſcern who are tares, or who may ſo continue: but this is no way to infringe either the Magiſtrates power in reference unto the ſword, which is an Ordinance of God, and he is not to bear it in vain, nor Church-officers power of the Keys, who are not after all admonition and means uſed to reclaim them to <hi>bear them that be evil,</hi> but <hi>to put away wicked perſons,</hi> and <hi>to deliver men to Satan for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſoul may be ſaved in the day of the Lord:</hi> neither is this Parable to be expounded ſo as to croſs other plain and clear Scriptures; for the Scripture is to be taken together, and the hard places of it are to be interpreted by them that are more clear.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God ſtirs up the ſpirits of wicked Magiſtrates for the good of the Saints; as we ſee it in <hi>Cyrus,</hi> though he were a cruel and a bloody Prince, yet he takes care for the building of the Temple, and gives forth commands for that work; and therefore <hi>Eſa.</hi> 44. <hi>ult.</hi> he doth ſay unto <hi>Cyrus, Thou art my ſhepherd;</hi> and ſo <hi>Alexander</hi> when he came to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Jaddus</hi> the High Prieſt came forth to meet him, by the providence of God it was ſo ordered, that he did give the Jews great priviledges, greater than any of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Nations, inſomuch that the Samaritans did ſtile themſelves Jews alſo, that they might partake in the ſame priviledges with them; <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> gave commandment unto <hi>Nabuzaradin</hi> the Captain of his Guard concerning <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> God over-ruling his ſpirit therein, that the Prophet was cheriſhed rather than evilly intreated by him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3 By ſtirring up the ſpirits of wicked men to ſtand for a good cauſe, and to aſſiſt the people of God therein; as we ſee when <hi>Lot</hi> was carried Captive by the Kings, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> did purſue them,<note place="margin">Gen. 14. <hi>ult.</hi>
                     </note> and there did joyn with him <hi>Aner</hi> and <hi>Eſcol,</hi> &amp;c. they that were but Heathens, yet were aſſiſtant unto <hi>Abraham</hi> in ſuch a work as this, the Lord did ſtir up their ſpirits; and ſo he doth many times by an over-ruling power ſtir up the ſpirits of men, otherwiſe uningaged and unintereſſed, to be inſtruments and means that the people of God may attain their rights, and all of it is only by this over-ruling hand of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of Chriſt even over ungodly men.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By their Perſecutions, the Lord doth ſtir men up many times to perſecute his people; <hi>Nebuchadnezzar is the rod of mine anger,</hi> and <hi>I ſend him againſt an hypocritical nation,</hi> though he know it not; but this is all the fruit, it is to take away their ſin, for by this ſhall the iniquity of <hi>Jacob</hi> be purged, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 27.9. it is to make them to beat their Altars into chalk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and let me tell you (becauſe we may look for times of perſecution) that great hath been the victory and the glory that the people of God have gotten even by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of ungodly men, <hi>nunquam majore triumpho vicimus.</hi> Nay if it be but a mock, a ſcoff, a reproach, a falſe report from an evil ſpirit, the Lord makes his uſe of it; as we have an inſtance in <hi>Auſtins</hi> mother, ſhe had by cuſtom, rather than inclination, learned to drink up full cups <hi>inhianter,</hi> but after a while the maid of the houſe and ſhe fell out, and in their difference the maid <hi>objecit hoc crimen amariſſimâ inſultatione, vocans meribibu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam, quo illa ſtimulo percuſſa reſpexit foeditatem, confeſtim<expan>

                  <p n="6">6. Their deſertions, and proving falſe to the people of God many times and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them, as <hi>Egypt</hi> proved a broken reed, turn to the Saints good; that ſo they might cleave to the Lord alone, and that they may ſee that there is a deceit in all their former Lovers, there is no truſt unto ſuch men that ſpeak lyes in hypocriſie, and follow Gods cauſe and people only for loaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and God permits them ſo to do, that the people of God may ſay <hi>their truſt is in the Name of the Lord only, Aſſur ſhall not ſave us any more, nor King Jareb;</hi> they have all deceived us as a brook that paſſes by, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in many more particulars, as</p>

                  <p n="1">1.

(3) <hi>Propter ſubordinationem, by reaſon of their ſubordination,</hi> they all act in their places, and do the ſervice unto which they are particularly appointed, they do every one keep their ranks, fire and hail, ſnow and vapour, wind and ſtorm fulfilling his word; they do not thruſt one another out of their place, but there is a military order obſerved amongſt them. (4) <hi>Propter obedientiam, in regard of their obedience,</hi> they do all of them obey the word of command, which they do receive from the great Commander, for they are all of them under command; as the Centurion ſaid of his ſervants, <hi>I ſay to one, Go, and he goes,</hi> ſo doth the Lord alſo ſay unto the creatures; for it is ſaid, that even before an army of Locuſts, Caterpillars, and Palmer-worms, <hi>the Lord doth utter his voice,</hi> he doth command the winds and the ſea, and they obey him.</p>

                  <p>But you will ſay, <hi>In what particular do all theſe little things work for the good of the Saints?</hi> It will clearly appear in theſe particulars. 1. In the ſmalleſt things the people ſee God, and their ſpirits are elevated and raiſed up to behold him in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for not only the Heavens declare the Glory of God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.1.</note> but even the meaneſt Creatures in all their motions do it; <hi>Repraeſentat quaelibet herba Deum.</hi> Now there is a threefold Viſion of God in <hi>this World,</hi> in his <hi>Works,</hi> and in his <hi>Word,</hi> and in his <hi>Son;</hi> and it is of ſpecial uſe, that the works of God are unto the Saints in all their being and motions, that they can ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of God in them. <hi>Our Communion with God depends upon our Viſion of God,</hi> and the more we ſee God in all things, the more we converſe with him. Now there is not the leaſt of all the Creation of God but it doth repreſent him to us, and we look upon it
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:52030:231"/> as a footſtep of God, it is that which doth raiſe up our hearts unto Heaven while we are upon Earth, and cauſeth us to look upon nothing ſmall that hath ſo glorious a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and ſo wiſe a Diſpoſer; <hi>in minimis lauda magnum,</hi> ſays <hi>Auſtin</hi> when he ſpeaks <hi>de culice;</hi> there is much of God to be ſeen, and the heart is much to be over-aw'd not only in the leſſer things of the Word, but alſo of the Works of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is unto the people of God matter of praiſe, even in the actings of the meaneſt of the creatures, to ſee how they work unto an end that they know not, but the wiſe diſpoſer of them knows all their motions, and directs them unto his end; <hi>the out-goings of the morning and evening do praiſe thee,</hi> that is, <hi>objectivè</hi> and <hi>occaſionaliter,</hi> as they give unto his people matter and occaſion of praiſe.

                  <p n="3">3. There is great matter of Meditation even in theſe ordinary things, ſuch as do mightily affect the Souls of the Saints; it was ſo to <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 148.7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>Praiſe the Lord from the earth ye Dragons, and all deeps, fire and hail, ſnow and vapours, ſtormy wind, fulfilling his Word, mountains and all hills, fruitful trees and all cedars, Beaſts and all cattel, creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, and flying fowls;</hi> and how can this be? <hi>Nudae creaturae Deum celebrant,</hi>

                     <hi>dum ad mirandam ejus ſapientiam, &amp; potentiam quotidie oſtendunt.</hi> The dangers prevented, and the good things conferred, ſuch as are ſecrets unto us, and we know not, we conſider not of; as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith of himſelf in the like caſe, <hi>Somnia noſtra obſervat, quando neſcimus nos vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>equidem odi carnem meam quòd haec ſcio vera eſſe, &amp; iis tamen non ſeriò afficior,</hi> &amp;c. It gives the Soul high matter of Meditation, puts it into the Mount with God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is unto the People of God a great ground of exerciſing their Faith, and that in two things, (1) Upon the word of Promiſe, that all theſe creatures are his by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in all their motions, and therefore he has not a common intereſt in them, with the reſt of the world, but they come unto him from another hand, and he receives them by another tenure. Now any mercy that has the reſpect of the Covenant put upon it, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely heightned unto them; <hi>the ſmalleſt mercy enjoy'd by Covenant, is better than the greateſt without the Covenant;</hi> it is better be as low as Hell with a promiſe, than in Paradiſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: therefore it is true, that other men walk upon the Stones and they hurt them not, and the Beaſts break not in upon them, the Sun ſhines, and the Rain falls upon them; yet here is the ſweetneſs to a Believer, This I enjoy as a fruit of an everlaſting Covenant, as an heir of Promiſe, and as a Pledge of an eternal Inheritance. (2) It will be a ground to exerciſe a mans Faith for a ſupport; if the Lord cloath the graſs of the field, how much more will he cloath you? and if he feeds the Ravens, he will ſurely not ſtarve his Children; nay, if the ſupply of all the Creatures will be a Proviſion for you, you ſhall not want it, they ſhall all act for you, and if it were poſſible to put a Saint of God in this life in ſuch a condition as he ſhould want the ſupply of all the creatures at once, they ſhould ſurely all work for his good; for the Lord provides them of purpoſe, and for that very end that they may work for you, and therefore are they continued in their being, and to that end are govern'd by him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Love of the People of God is drawn out by them exceedingly, even by ſmall Mercies; for <hi>it is not the greatneſs of the Bleſſing, but the abundance of Love diſcovered to the ſoul in it, that takes a gracious heart:</hi> for we love him becauſe he loved us firſt. And as his love is diſcovered, ſuch are the outgoings of our love to him again. Now theſe ſmall things may be <hi>magni amoris indicium;</hi> an ordinary turn of the creature may teſtifie a great deal of love from God to the Soul, as when <hi>Iſrael</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 19.36.</note> 
                     <hi>not a Dog did move his tongue,</hi> Exod. 11.7. if they had, the matter had not been great, for in the night they uſe to bark; but though there was a great cry amongſt the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> yet amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> not a Dog did move his tongue. <hi>Signum eſt magni ſilentii dum canes ſilent.</hi> A great love may be ſeen in an ordinary Providence to a man, as Grapes to be had in a wilderneſs, as a Meſſenger ſent one of a thouſand, a word ſpoken in due ſeaſon, a Scripture opened to me when I had need, it was directed to me in my neceſſity; ſuch a comfort admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred at ſuch a time, when I was in extremity, and it came in the ſeaſon of it, it is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of great love; as when <hi>David</hi> was beſieged, and <hi>Saul</hi> thought that he had them ſure, now a report muſt be brought that the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> had invaded the Land, and ſo change his Counſels, and divert the forces from purſuing <hi>David.</hi>

                  <p n="7">7. Ordinary things ſhall tend unto the deſtruction of the enemies, and they ſhall fall by the turning of an ordinary providence, the ſmalleſt things ſhall even ruine perſons and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all <hi>Egypt</hi> were even deſtroyed by flies and lice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Sun ſhines upon the water, and they ſhall ſay that it is blood; <hi>The Kings have deſtroyed one another,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3.22, 23. Sometimes by the turning of the wind, great things have been done for the people of God, great battels have been won both by Land and Sea; and ſometimes by rain, ſtrange things have been wrought for the defeating of the counſels of enemies; <hi>Thou breakeſt the ſhips of Tarſhiſh with an Eaſt-wind,</hi> &amp;c. And we know what ſmall provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences have caſt the balance for the people of God againſt the enemies, and that in many doubtful caſes, when they had nothing but providence to work for them.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Conſider how by ſmall and ordinary things the Lord doth preſerve the lives, and ſupport his people in the world, by cauſing the Sun to ſhine, and the rain to fall, the earth to bring forth, the fig-tree to bloſſom; and we ſee he gives them food out of the earth, and the beaſts do them ſervice, and they do it willingly and readily. Now what a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable life were the life even of a Saint here, if it were not for ſuch common and ordinary refreſhments; if the Lord ſhould as a Lion watch over us, as he doth threaten them, <hi>he would be as a Lion and a Leopard in the way,</hi> to obſerve them? There is a providence that hath given theſe unto the ſons of God as their inheritance, ſo that they do injoy the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of them, and eat the fruit of them day by day; <hi>the ſervice of thy hand maid, and of thy beaſt,</hi> all act for thee, as being made by God to be thy ſervants. It is true, that the ſervice of the Angels is comfortable, but it would not be ſufficient without theſe which are ours in a way of ordinary providence;<note place="margin">Cogita te eſſe in regione de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerti, &amp; in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrinatione vitae, <hi>Aug.</hi>
                     </note> and ſuch as we account leſs, though we taſte the good of them from day to day.

                     <hi>SECT. IV.</hi> The Saints Intereſt in Gods Providential Kingdom, both mediate and immediate, neceſſary and contingent.</head>
                  <p n="1">§. 1. WE have gone thorow the firſt diſtinction of the providential Kingdom, we come now to the ſecond, which is, that Providence is either <hi>immediate</hi> or <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate.</hi> The one is when the Lord works without means, putting forth his own power imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the producing of any effect, without the concurrence of any means or help of ſecond cauſes, and this is called making bare his arm, or making it naked, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 52.10. So long as the Lord doth work by means, though there be his hand, yet his hand is hid, and covered under the appearance of creatures, ſo that our eyes are either wholly or mainly upon them; but when the Lord lays creatures aſide, and his own arm doth appear to bring ſalvation, ſo that nothing elſe is ſeen but the hand of God in it, without the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of creatures, the Lord is then ſaid to make bare his own arm, that is, to ſhew forth his own power,<note place="margin">Hab. 3.9.</note> purely and nakedly; ſo <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.9. <hi>His bow was quite made naked,</hi> &amp;c. he ſpeaks it of the diſcoveries of Gods power in an immediate way, and his bow is <hi>vis tua, ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bur tuum, Druſ.</hi> he ſpeaks it of the dividing of the red Sea, and the turning back of <hi>Jordan</hi> in its own chanel, the power of God did immediately appear without any concurrence of means, and any inſtrument or ſecond cauſes, and therefore his <hi>bow was naked,</hi> &amp;c. the Scripture doth ſpeak of the Lords <hi>ſmiting with the rod and with his fiſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And here there are three Propoſitions that I muſt lay down.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That whatever the Lord does by means, he can work immediately by his own hand, without all means:</hi> he that did give being unto the ſecond cauſes, can without thoſe cauſes produce their effects; he is independent in his working, as well as in his being, and doth not depend upon means and ſecond cauſes in any thing that he doth; and therefore if he do deprive his people of the means, and will ſupply it in himſelf, it ſhall be infinitely better, they <hi>ſhall have a hundredfold more in this life eminenter; the Sun ſhall be no more thy light by day, but the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:52030:232"/> glory of the Lord ſhall be the light thereof:</hi> if he deprive them of the light of the Sun, yet he gives them his own glory to be inſtead thereof, and it ſhall abundantly anſwer it. He hath indeed bound us in duty to uſe the means, but he hath not bound himſelf, he is ſtill at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty either to work by his own immediate hand, or in the way that he hath ſet in the order and ſubordination of cauſes, yea as much as if no ſuch order had been made by him; and therefore the time will come when God <hi>ſhall be all in all;</hi> and this order of cauſes ſhall ſurely ceaſe, and then all effects ſhall be produced by God immediately, and that in a far more glorious manner, than now they are by the influences of their cauſes amongſt the creatures.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In the means which he doth uſe, there is an immediate concurrence of his own power to the producing of the effect: concurrit immediatè, &amp;c.</hi> and without this the ſecond cauſe could do nothing, <hi>men live not by bread only;</hi> and therefore if God do withdraw his acting or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it, the ſecond cauſe is of no value; it is but as an axe in the hand of a man, or as a pen, it is but as it were a dead inſtrument, as the Apoſtle ſays of himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.2, 3. and therefore the people of God put no confidence in them: <hi>I will not truſt in my bow, and it is not my ſword that ſhall ſave me; it is thou, O Lord, that ſaveſt us from our enemies:</hi> this is the language of a true Saint; and therefore it is only the Lords withdrawing, and then all ſecond cauſes work not: whence it is ſaid, <hi>That they ſhall eat, and they ſhall not be nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they ſhall put on cloaths, but not be warmed:</hi> there is a natural aptitude in theſe means to produce ſuch effects; but yet if the Lord do but ſuſpend his influx, they can do nothing. And therefore in the Babyloniſh Furnace, Divines do commonly ſay, that the Lord did not take away the nature of the fire, it remained to be fire ſtill, only in reference unto ſuch an object he did ſuſpend his own concurrence; ſo that, though it remained <hi>in actu primo,</hi> yet it was not able to produce <hi>actum ſecundum,</hi> becauſe the immediate concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the firſt cauſe was denied: ſo it is in all means, and this is the reaſon of their want of efficacy; the ſame Ordinances would be as effectual at one time as at another, and unto one man as unto another, there is no difference in the means, only in the concurrence of the firſt cauſe with the means; and ſo it is with creatures alſo, the ſame land would be as fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful at one time as at another, and there is no difference, only <hi>when thou tilleſt thy land it ſhall not yield its ſtrength,</hi> ſays the Lord, there is not the ſame concurrence of God with it, which is his bleſſing upon it, and that is the true reaſon of all the difference in the uſe and the ſucceſs of means whatſoever.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Though the Lord doth in the adminiſtration of all things in the providential Kingdom uſe means, and therefore hath made all things in a due order and ſubordination, yet he doth delight ſometimes to work without means, by his own immediate hand, not by power nor by might, but by my Spirit, Zac.</hi> 4.7. if there be none to help, yet his own arm ſhall bring ſalvation. And the Lord doth this, (1) that he may ſometimes ſhew forth ſome ſpecial diſcoveries of his own power. The heart of man would be wholly terminated in the creature, as we are very apt to be, and we would look no further, therefore the Lord is pleaſed ſometimes to ſhew forth ſomething more than the power of the creature; and ſometimes he will go in an ordinary way of nature, ſometimes in a miraculous way to ſhew, that there is a higher hand that rules all things, that he may not be forgotten by us. (2) To ſhew that he doth not uſe the creature neceſſarily, but voluntarily; and therefore he can uſe it or lay it aſide at his pleaſure, work by it, or work without it, that the ſouls of his people may depend upon him alone, both in the want and in the injoyments of the creature; and the good effect is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the further off when they want it, nor ever the nearer when they do injoy it, whether they have it or not, it is all one, they can rejoyce in the Lord, and glory in the God of their ſalvation, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17, 18. (3) That he may ſtill keep up in the remembrance of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a creating power; when there was nothing but himſelf immediately, there was no means uſed. It hath been diſputed by the School-men, <hi>Whether the miniſtry of Angels were not uſed in the creation of the world?</hi> and it is commonly anſwered, No it was not, it could not be, becauſe in the exerciſe of almighty power there can be no concurrence of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, no creature can be raiſed by the power of God unto ſuch an elevation, as to be made capable to put forth any act of omnipotence; and therefore that this power of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God may be kept up, he doth do the like often in the world; that as he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a <hi>day</hi> to remember the Creation, and would have us to remember our Creator, ſo he doth <hi>works,</hi> that he may keep it continually in our remembrance; providence is ſaid to be nothing but a <hi>continued Creation,</hi> therefore the Lord will do ſomething that ſhall be as a Creation ſtill, that this great work may never be forgotten; he that doth create grace in the ſouls of men daily, doth put forth other acts anſwerable thereunto. (4) The Lord doth it, that he may train up his people by it unto a remembrance of Heaven, where all means ſhall ceaſe; for <hi>God ſhall be all in all,</hi> that is, he ſhall be all unto his people im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:52030:233"/> It is true, that the Saints do injoy God here, and they injoy all in God, he is their portion and their hope, but all this is in the uſe of means; as they ſee him in a glaſs, ſo they ſhall injoy him alſo: but there is a time that will ſhortly come, when all means ſhall be done away, and he that now governs the world, and ſo diſpenſes himſelf by ſecond cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, will do all by his own immediate hand; there ſhall be immediate, therefore pure mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and pure wrath, and pure power, and pure acts of Omnipotence. In this life we are by the creatures refreſhed, and when he comforts us by the creature, thoſe comforts loſe much by reaſon of the veſſel; and ſo when he doth teach us by the creature, that treaſure is in earthen veſſels, it is much otherwiſe when he teaches himſelf immediately; and ſo when he doth puniſh by the creature, it is but as a mighty man correcting a man with a ſtraw: it's true, that he is mighty, but it is but a ſmall thing that is in his hand, which is nothing in compariſon of that which ſhall be hereafter; it ſhall be all immediate, and that keeps up in his people an expectation of this, that they may have herein a kind of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte of Heaven, by beholding the immediate working of God without the help of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or their concurrence.</p>
                  <p>Now this immediate acting of Providence is wholly for the good of his people, and is ſo managed; ſometimes he will uſe means for their good, and ſometimes he will for their good work without means, but ſtill ſo as his Soveraignty is made over unto them in theſe his actings: and herein we are to obſerve,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Scripture ſpeaking of a <hi>creating power,</hi> which the Lord doth often put forth for the good of his people,<note place="margin">Eſa. 4.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 4.5. there 'tis ſaid, <hi>I create upon every dwelling place a cloud,</hi> &amp;c. Upon every dwelling place there is a protection, that which is immediate and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power of ſecond cauſes, when there is no defence in them, yet their ſuccour ſhall be from the immediate hand of God, and that by a creating work, that when the people ſhall look to the creatures and ſay, we ſee no means to defend us, yet they can look to an immediate acting of Omnipotency,<note place="margin">Eſa. 67.17.</note> and that by a creating work for his people: <hi>I create a heaven and a new earth wherein dwells righteouſneſs:</hi> it is ſpoken of the glorious reformation that ſhall be in the later days; it is there ſpoken not of renewing the ſubſtance, but of the qualities of Heaven and Earth, a glorious reſtitution of their primitive and original glory, a mighty work, that God ſhall not only paſs upon Saints, but on the creatures, which ſhall be reſtored and <hi>delivered into the glorious liberty of the ſons of God;</hi> and he that looks upon the corruptions of men, and the deſolations of nations, and the confuſions amongſt the creatures that ſhall be immediately before thoſe days, he will ſay, <hi>How can theſe things be?</hi> It is impoſſible that ſuch a glorious reformation ſhould be wrought. But to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then their faith, and to raiſe them up to expect it, he puts them off from ſecond cauſes, and tells them it ſhall be an act of almighty power, it is by a <hi>creating</hi> work; and ſurely the ſame hand, and the ſame power that did make them at firſt, can alſo renew them, and reſtore them unto their primitive and original glory; that as the ſaid immediate power is put forth for the renewing of their ſouls, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. <hi>We are created in Chriſt to good works,</hi> all is made new within him by an immediate power, ſo alſo all ſhall be made new without him by an immediate providence; that though there be no concurrence of means and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes, yet if God can make a new world, then he can renew this, he can create a new Heaven and a new Earth, and he can <hi>create Jeruſalem a rejoycing, and the people a joy,</hi> as the promiſe is unto them; ſo that the Lord will not always work for his people in a <hi>ruling,</hi> but ſometimes in a <hi>creating</hi> way, in which there is an immediate putting forth of power, and there is not, there cannot be any concurrence of means or ſecond cauſes with it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God puts forth an immediate providence for the Churches <hi>preſervation;</hi> he doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times work immediately, when there is no help in ſecond cauſes, but all men are inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on the contrary part; <hi>and the Lord looks, and there is none to help, and the Lord wonders that there was no interceſſor;</hi> no helping of them, none to intercede for them, there was none ſo much as by way of prayer that comes in for them; and yet now the Church muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,<note place="margin">Zac. 4.23.</note> 
                     <hi>Zac.</hi> 4.2, 3. the <hi>Candleſtick</hi> is the Church, but by what means ſhall this be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained? there can be no ſupply of oil expected from men, but the Lord will make Olive-trees to grow by it, that ſhall make oil of themſelves, and ſhall drop into the bails there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that though no men in the world ſtand by it, or prepare for it, yet the Lord will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it in an immediate way, from himſelf, and by himſelf, and by this means the lamp in this Candleſtick ſhall never go out, for by an immediate proviſion of God they ſhall be maintained,<note place="margin">Mic. 5.7.</note> 
                     <hi>Mic.</hi> 5.7. <hi>The remnant of Jacob ſhall be as dew from the Lord, and as ſhowers upon the graſs;</hi> when they were Jezreel ſtrengthned by the Lord, though amongſt many people that ſhould hate them and perſecute them, yet ſhould they be preſerved; and therefore as <hi>Calvin</hi> obſerves, <hi>rorem pro prato rorido,</hi> like unto the herbs which are nouriſhed
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:52030:233"/> by the dew from Heaven, and by the ſhowres from above, which ſtay not for man, it tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries not for the ſons of men: that as the graſs is nouriſhed immediately by the dew, and doth not depend upon the labours and the watering of man; ſo ſhall theſe from God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, there ſhall come from him an immediate dew, an influence ſhall come, by which they ſhall be ſupported, that they ſhall not need to ſtay for any creatures aſſiſtance, or any concurrence of ſecond cauſes whatſoever.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is an immediate Providence that is ſeen in reſtraints upon the ſouls and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of men, when there are no hindrances in ſecond cauſes, and yet this ſhall work for the people of God: ſee it <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. <hi>Sarah</hi> was in the hand of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and his luſt was ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up towards her, when he heard of her, and there was nothing to hinder him but he might have had his will of her, and yet for <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſake ſhe was returned unto him chaſt and undefiled; but it was by an immediate working of God upon his ſpirit, when there were no ſecond cauſes in the way, the Lord ſaith, <hi>I did hold thee, that thou ſhouldſt not touch her.</hi> And the ſame thing is true of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they went up to worſhip at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and all the males left their habitation, the fitteſt advantage that could be for the neighbouring Nations, who hated them, and ſought to invade them, and did it at other times, yet that now they ſhould not have made inrodes upon their Land in the ſeveral bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders thereof, when there was no reſtraint in ſecond cauſes, no man can give a reaſon for it but the immediate working of providence, that the Lord doth put forth his power upon the ſpirits of men, that it ſhall be enough if he withhold them. There is a bridle without and there is a bridle within, by which the ſpirits of men are turned about, there is a <hi>hedge for mens ways,</hi> God doth many times hedge up mens ways with thorns; but there is a hedge for the <hi>ſpirits</hi> of men alſo, that when there is no hindrance in ſecond cauſes, and none to lift up a hand againſt them, yet their ſpirits are reſtrained by an immediate hand. And indeed when the ſecrets of the counſels of Gods providence ſhall be made manifeſt at the laſt day, many and glorious will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he records of ſuch immediate puttings forth of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence be. We have an inſtance in <hi>Eſau,</hi> his malice was ſtirred, and he had power in his hand, he had three hundred men by which he might have cut off his brother <hi>Jacob,</hi> but only there was an immediate appearance of God upon his ſpirit, and that put a reſtraint upon him, that he could not ſo much as ſpeak an ill word unto his brother.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Lord appears immediately for the deſtruction of the Churches enemies, when their means fail. When there was no help from ſecond cauſes to deſtroy <hi>Egypt</hi> or deliver themſelves, for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had no power, but they cryed unto the Lord, and in the night the Lord looked upon the <hi>Egyptians</hi> hoſt and troubled them, and took off their chariot-wheels, and they drove heavily, and there was a terrour upon their hearts, that they ſaid, Let us flye, for God fights for <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And ſo he will do in the deſtruction of Antichriſt, <hi>the little horn,</hi> who doth ariſe with the ten horns, and he is ſtrong not by his own power, for <hi>the ten Kings give their kingdoms to him,</hi> and he doth exerciſe the power of the former beaſt before him, and it is ſaid <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.25. <hi>He ſhall be broken without hands,</hi> that is, by the <hi>breath of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>the brightneſs of his coming,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2.</note> by an immediate manifeſtation of God againſt him, not by any power of ſecond cauſes; for the people of God may expect the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate workings of providence for them that they have had in times paſt, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 10.26. <hi>He will ſtir up a ſcourge for them according to the ſlaughter of Midian,</hi> and he ſhall lift it up after the manner of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Now as for that of <hi>Egypt</hi> it was by an immediate appearance of God, when there was no means uſed; and ſo for that of <hi>Midian, Judg.</hi> 7.19, 20. they blew the Trumpets, and they broke their pitchers, and that was all that was done, which was a means that of it ſelf had no influence into the effect, but the Lord ſet every mans ſword againſt his fellow; and ſuch immediate diſcoveries and actings of providence the Lord doth promiſe unto his people, and they may expect them from him in all their ſtraits, when the enemy comes in like a floud, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. They may expect immediate deliverances: <hi>Laban</hi> came out againſt <hi>Jacob</hi> with an evil intention, but he ſaith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.29. <hi>It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt, but the God of your fathers ſpoke to me yeſternight, ſaying, Take thou heed that thou ſpeak not to Jacob either good or bad.</hi> And ſo <hi>Balaam</hi> had a will to curſe the people of God, and he wanted no incouragement and ſolicitation from the King of <hi>Moab</hi> to do it, and yet remember what <hi>Balack</hi> conſulted, and what <hi>Balaam</hi> anſwered. And the inſtance of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when his hand was up to flay his ſon, and the Lord called to him out of Heaven, <hi>Stay thy hand,</hi>

As ſinning is a warfare, and wicked men in that do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their diſcharge, and it is in providence ordered ſo, that they dye when it is in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them, when they leaſt expect it, and are leaſt prepared for it; ſo godly men dye when their graces are perfected, and their work is finiſhed, and never till then: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they ſought <hi>Luthers</hi> life ſo much, yet he could write this upon the wall of his Study, <hi>I ſhall not dye but live, and declare the works of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. And there are ſome men upon this account can laugh at dangers in a way of ſervice, and deride threatnings as the crackling of thorns under a pot, becauſe they ſay, <hi>My time is not in your hands,</hi> neither the time of my life, nor of my ſervice, and he that imploys me will uphold me, and will maintain me till the time of my diſmiſſion ſhall come, and then I ſhall go off the ſtage of this world in mercy, and lye down in peace, and reſt upon my bed after the time of my labour is ended.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. There is a ſpecial Providence in bleſſing and providing for their poſterity; God has a ſpecial providence over thoſe that come out of the loyns of his own; for indeed he has ſo ordered all his Decrees, as that the greateſt part of the Elect comes out of the loyns of the Saints, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.7. <hi>His children are bleſſed after him;</hi> there is grace in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that is promiſed unto them, but 'tis a bleſſedneſs that doth deſcend upon them by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their parents Covenant, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 59.21. <hi>My words which I have put in thy mouth ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, ſaith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever:</hi> and <hi>Eſa.</hi> 44.3. <hi>I will pour my Spirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing upon thy off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Auſtin</hi> was <hi>filius lacrymarum,</hi> the ſon of his mothers prayers and tears, and the Lord did give an anſwer by giving the ſoul of her ſon unto her, that he was graciouſly converted unto the Lord, and proved an eminent inſtrument for ſervice in the Church of the Lord. The Saints can with <hi>Jacob</hi> pronounce upon them a bleſſing when they dye, and that out of faith in the promiſe, and the Lord willſurely make it good unto them; but <hi>we are begotten not of blood, Joh.</hi> 1.13. And therefore though many times ungodly men may and do come out of the loyns of the Saints, and the ſpiritual part of the Covenant is not made good unto many of the poſterity of his own people, yet the outward part of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ſurely is; though the Covenant for matter of grace be unto <hi>Iſaac,</hi> yet there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of it that is made good to <hi>Iſmael: Twelve Princes ſhall he beget, he hath the dew of heaven, and the fatneſs of the earth.</hi> God doth in outward things ſtrangely ſupply them, and provide for them: when the children of the wicked are vagabonds and beg their bread, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.25. <hi>Yet I never ſaw the righteous forſaken, nor his ſeed begging bread.</hi>

(1) Begging of bread is taken for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of poverty, the ſeed of the righteous are never ſo poor, but the Lord doth find out a way of ſupport and ſupply for them; he has ſaid, <hi>That the juſt ſhall inherit the earth.</hi> (2) It is not meant that it was never ſo, that they were never poor, but in <hi>Davids</hi> experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he had never found it ſo. (3) There is another interpretation of <hi>Muis,</hi> and that is, <hi>ſemen ejus quaerens panem non derelictum,</hi> not forſaken, though begging of their bread; the Jews in this miſery that they are, yet grow rich where-ever they come, the temporal promiſe is fulfilled to them.

And this I ſhall branch into two heads. (1) <hi>The Soveraignty of God over a mans own ſins for the good of his people.</hi> (2) <hi>Over other mens ſins;</hi> he doth ſo imploy his Soveraignty about the ſins of men, that they ſhall be ordered for the good of the Saints.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Soveraignty and Supremacy of God in reference unto the ſins of his own people;</hi> the Lord doth ſo rule and order all things thereby, that their own ſins ſhall in ſome kind work for their good, that which in its own nature is only evil, can by an almighty over-ruling
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:52030:238"/> hand, turn into good; which no man in the world is able to do; they may make good uſe of things in themſelves good, but they are never able to bring good out of that which is <hi>per ſe malum, of it ſelf ſinfull,</hi> as ſin is; and this I ſhall demonſtrate to you in four things, (1) In reſpect of <hi>the being of ſin.</hi> (2) In reſpect of <hi>the riſing of ſin.</hi> (3) In reſpect of <hi>the actings of ſin.</hi> (4) In reſpect of <hi>the raging of ſin,</hi> in an open violent ſcandalous way.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It will appear in reference unto the <hi>being of ſin</hi> in the Saints. The Lord, who has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid all ſin even in the Principles and being of it, and has ſent his Son to take away ſin, yet he has in his Soveraignty ſo ordered the condition of the Saints here, that ſin ſhall have a being in them, and they ſhall never be perfectly freed from it; ſo that it will be true of the beſt while they are here, <hi>he that ſaith he has no ſin deceiveth himſelf,</hi> there will be <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiae vetuſtatis,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls it, <hi>a Law in the members, a body of death.</hi> To be without ſin here is given to us as <hi>praeceptum, a precept</hi> in this life, or elſe Original ſin were no ſin, and the being of ſin were againſt no Law of God; the Law requires a holy Nature, as well as holy Actions; but in the life to come it ſhall be given to us as <hi>praemium,</hi> a <hi>reward;</hi> here as <hi>a Law,</hi> and hereafter as a <hi>Reward.</hi> And why has the Sovereignty of God ſo ordered it that thoſe that ſhall be freed from ſin perfectly in the Life to come, and whom Chriſt ſhall <hi>preſent without ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing,</hi> why will he ſuffer them to have the Remainders of ſin in them in this life, and they ſhall never be freed from it till their diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution? We ſhall eaſily ſee that he, as the Lord of all, has ordered this by his Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Supremacy for the good of his people, and that it was for their ſakes.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) That hereby he may exalt the Grace of Juſtification unto the Saints; for God to pardon ſins paſt, it were rich mercy, infinite mercy; but for the Lord to leave ſin remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a man, and while he is conflicting with it, and fears he ſhall be overcome with it every moment, ſees himſelf ſtill to remain a ſinner, and yet the grace of Juſtification ſtill to hold out, that as there is in me a Fountain of ſin, ſo God is the Father of mercies, and he doth not only pardon at firſt, but when I ſin and endeavour to make a breach upon my Juſtification again, he ſhews mercy ſtill, and doth multiply to pardon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. this exalts the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed in juſtification; for <hi>tolle morbos, tolle vulnera, &amp; nulla erit medicinae cauſa.</hi> Dam. Therefore a man doth daily waſh his feet, and ſees the Sun of Righteouſneſs to riſe upon him daily, that he may be juſtifi'd not only from the Acts of ſin, but alſo from the remainders and Reliques of ſin that are in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.10. And this alſo doth exalt the grace of God the Father juſtifying. When the Apoſtle had had more than ordinary experience of the remainders of corruption in him, and was much afflicted, looking upon himſelf as a miſerable man by reaſon thereof, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf worthy to be deſtroy'd for it, and might by reaſon thereof have expected the ſentence of death every moment; now he looks upon the grace of the Goſpel as juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and he finds a new ſweetneſs in it; there <hi>is now no condemnation unto them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 8.1. Not only the ſins committed before Converſion, but the ſins re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining after, do juſtly make the ſoul liable to condemnation: but ſuch is the grace that juſtifies us, that there is no condemnation unto them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) That there may be a continual Conflict kept up in us; our life is a <hi>Warfare;</hi> and therefore <hi>Job</hi> 14.14. it is ſaid, <hi>all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change come,</hi> it is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>all the days, militiae meae, of my warfare,</hi> this is not againſt enemies without, againſt ſpiritual wickedneſſes in high places only, but againſt enemies within, in a ſpecial manner, the Fleſh luſting againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh, and by this means the war is maintain'd. The Lord will have the time of this life to be <hi>tempus militiae,</hi> a <hi>time of warfare,</hi> and the other life <hi>laetitiae, of triumph,</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks; this <hi>laboris, of labour,</hi> that <hi>mercedis, of reward;</hi> and there is no conflict in the world like unto this, to have two contraries in the ſame place, each of them ſtriving to deſtroy one another; and yet neither of them compleatly and totally prevailing; for they are contrary, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. and there is a greater oppoſition againſt ſin than there is againſt the Devils themſelves, or any enemies without: there are the ſoreſt battels fought between fleſh and ſpirit in the ſame ſoul, and with greater diſpleaſure and indignation againſt them, than Saints againſt the Devil himſelf; for this is the greateſt evil to them, becauſe it is in them; and becauſe the Lord will have a conflict, that ſo the graces of his People may be both exerciſed, and alſo tryed, and improved; the power of Grace and the truth of it, would never have been ſo gloriouſly ſeen, if there had not been ſuch a principle of corruption drawing it forth daily.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) That he may keep his people humble: there is no one thing that the Lord takes more care of, than that the Saints ſhould not be lifted up; it is the end of Affliction to hide pride from their hearts; and of temptations and deſertions in the fleſh, that they might not be lifted up in themſelves, and exalted above meaſure. Now it's true, it's mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:52030:239"/> enough to humble one, if duely conſidered, to call to mind what he has been, as it did <hi>Paul, I was a perſecutor, and a blaſphemer, and injurious,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.13. As ſome of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, having riſen to be Kings from ſmall beginnings, would keep ſomething ſtill to put them in mind of their Original: as one being a Potters ſon would be ſerved only in Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Veſſels all his life-time. The remembrance of what is paſt might humble a man, to ſay, <hi>Such were ſome of you,</hi> ſuch were ye; but it is much more effectual to humble a man, to conſider, that very iniquity is not fully purged unto this day, but there are ſtill ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of it upon me, there is ſtill <hi>a law in my members that rebells againſt the law of my mind, that when I would do good evil is preſent with me;</hi> and this makes me to look upon my ſelf as a wretched and a miſerable man, and makes me to loath and abhor my ſelf, the ſame ſore is running upon me ſtill, I am ſenſible I have the leproſie, and therefore I can take no pleaſure in my ſelf, the Devil comes, and hath ſomething in me; there is a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that is prone to cloſe with any temptation, there is a ſea of corruption that doth but wait for a wind, nay if the Devil ſhould never diſquiet it, yet it is a Fountain that will caſt mire out of it ſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">(4) That the Saints may be exerciſed in Prayer and Repentance daily. Now it is that which the Lord requires of them every day; <hi>Pray without ceaſing,</hi> and a man is <hi>Nulli rei niſi poenitentiae natus,</hi> &amp;c. Now that there may be ſomething that we may ask of him daily to give us, that is, a further degree of Grace, a greater meaſure of purging, and that we may apply the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt for to mortifie ſin in us, as well as to ſatisfie God for ſin, and that there may be always ſomething that we may confeſs, and bewail before God, and repent of, and mourn for, this ſin is ſtill left in us: And look what benefits the people of God do receive from theſe conſtant and daily exerciſes, all theſe do flow from the Sovereignty of God towards them, in leaving of the remainders of ſin in them; and by this means we come to have a part in that great honour which belongs to Chriſt, and that is, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="5">(5) That the Patience and forbearance of God even towards the Veſſels of mercy may be ſo much the more exalted; <hi>Num.</hi> 14.17. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays, <hi>Let the Power of my Lord be great, according as thou haſt ſpoken, the Lord long-ſuffering and of great mercy;</hi> even his forbearance is an act of his power: it is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="7">(7) That the ſouls of the Saints may be kept here in a continual longing and a groaning condition for glory; there is nothing ſo great an evil as ſin, and therefore <hi>nothing ſhould make the ſoul weary of this life ſo much as ſin, becauſe it cannot end but with our life,</hi> and this is one bleſſed fruit of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>We groan for the Adoption;</hi> but why do we groan? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.24. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="3">§ 3. 2. As the being of ſin comes under the Soveraignty of God, ſo doth the <hi>riſing of it in the heart,</hi> which doth never break forth into act: it is true, that the heart of man is an <hi>evil treaſury,</hi> and it is an <hi>evil fountain;</hi> but though it be always iſſuing, yet it doth not vent it ſelf the ſame way, but ſometimes in this kind, and ſometimes in that,<note place="margin">Seneca.</note>

Now how comes it to paſs, that now one ſin riſeth in the heart, and ſometimes another ſin, when there is an equal propenſion unto all ſin? it riſeth out of the heart, but there is a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of God that doth order theſe motions and deſires in the heart, permitting ſuch motions and ſtirrings of heart now which he had not before, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Luſt conceiveth and brings forth ſin;</hi> there is original ſin the root of corruption, which is called Luſt,<note place="margin">Jam. 1.15</note> and that is the mother of all ſin, and it is ſaid <hi>to conceive,</hi> when it is formed into motions, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, conſultations, and deſires, and conſents; but yet there is many a luſt conceived that never is brought forth into act, and the permitting the riſing as well as of the being of luſt depends upon the Dominion and the Soveraignty of God. As there came into the heart of <hi>Eſau</hi> ſuch a reſolution, <hi>when my father is dead I will ſlay my brother Jacob:</hi> ſo there came a motion into the heart of <hi>Judas</hi> to betray Chriſt, and thereupon he conſulted how to do it with the greateſt advantage, and how to take the fitteſt opportunity to bring it to paſs; ſo a thought came into <hi>Davids</hi> heart to number the people, Satan ſtirred it up, but God in judgment giving him over, that it ſhould be at this time when God was angry with <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and <hi>Ezech.</hi> 38.10. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs at the ſame time, that things ſhall come into thy mind, and thou ſhalt think an evil thought;</hi> a thought that he did not think before, the time of his deſtruction was near then, ſuch motions ſhall ariſe, as it did in <hi>Ahab, Is not Ramoth in Gilead ours,</hi> &amp;c? which was the occaſion of his deſtruction. There is a providence even in the riſing of luſts in the hearts of his own people, that this luſt at this ſpecial time, and another luſt at another time, ſhould riſe in them: it is the ſame Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of God that doth draw forth gracious deſires in the Saints, and doth permit cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:52030:240"/> deſires in them alſo, <hi>God is not the Author, but the orderer of them,</hi> and yet even in this alſo the Soveraignty of God is exerciſed for the good of the Saints, and that many ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) In this, that all luſts break not forth in the ſoul continually: for luſt that is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all ſin, original ſin ſtands equally prepared unto all ſin, at all times; and therefore that all luſts be not ſtirring in the heart together, is from a glorious act of the ſoveraign reſtraint of God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.2. <hi>By ſwearing and lying and killing and ſtealing and committing adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery they break out,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>erumpunt:</hi> it is taken from waters that have been hid, or from fire ſhut up in an oven or a furnace, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.6. ſometimes it breaks forth into thoughts in the ſoul, and ſometimes into acts in the life. Now there is a double reſtraint that the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of God has over mens acts and over their luſts, and it's a great mercy to have acts of ſin reſtrained, as it was in <hi>Abimelech, Gen.</hi> 20.6. his luſt was let out, but God reſtrained the act; and it is a greater mercy to have the luſt reſtrained than the act, as the Lord ſaid, <hi>They ſhall not deſire thy land.</hi> Now the Lord doth reſtrain the Devils acts, but for his luſts he doth let them range; and ſo he doth very far alſo reſtrain the acts of wicked men, when he ſets no bounds unto their luſts: next to being freed from the being of ſin, it's a mercy to be delivered from the riſing of ſin, and in that there is a ſpecial manifeſtation of the Soveraignty of God: for if the riſing of one ſin be ſo troubleſom unto a godly man, that he ſtrives and prays and wreſtles with it, and it is unto him as the thorn in his fleſh, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be quiet in himſelf by reaſon of it; how miſerable and continually unquiet would the heart of a godly man be, if he ſhould have many ſuch ſtrangers and way-faring men come to him (as it was ſaid of the luſt that came into <hi>Davids</hi> heart?) how ſhould a godly man be able even to ſtand under the burden of them? therefore even this reſtraint of the riſing of ſome luſts is a ſpecial mercy; that <hi>Joſephs</hi> luſt ſhould not riſe and conceive in him at ſuch a time, and when he had ſuch an opportunity. And it is the greater becauſe I conceive the Spirit of God, by a peculiar work and not a common, doth reſtrain the luſts of the Saints. It's true, that there is reſtraining grace both unto the godly and the wicked, but not both from the ſame principle; but the Spirit having once taken poſſeſſion of a godly man for his own houſe and Temple, he doth never work common works in that man more, as a Spirit aſſiſting barely, but as a Spirit inhabiting.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) There is a great deal of mercy in the Lords ordering of the riſing of luſt, when luſt doth not riſe when the object is preſent; there is the object and the opportunity, but the luſt is paſt away, as <hi>Ruth</hi> lay at <hi>Boaz</hi> his feet all night, yet no luſt ariſeth towards her: and <hi>David</hi> had an opportunity of killing <hi>Saul;</hi> but yet when <hi>Saul</hi> was in his hand, and he was ſtirred up to it by his ſervants alſo, yet God reſtrained his luſt, it did not riſe in him; which we may ſee by the contrary in other men, as ſoon as the object is offered, the luſt is up in the young man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. he met a harlot, and he went after her ſtraight-ways; and there is a man that no ſooner ſees his neighbours wife, but he doth luſt after her, his luſt riſeth as ſoon as the object is preſented; and ſo it was with <hi>Achan, I ſaw, and I coveted, and I took;</hi> and ſo it is with many a man, let the leaſt ſhew or provocation be given, and his ſpirit is on fire immediately; but it was not ſo with <hi>Abraham,</hi> though he was the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter man, and had a better right than <hi>Lot,</hi> yet in the contention, the luſt of pride and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion did not ariſe in him: <hi>Let there be no ſtrife between me and thee, for we are brethren.</hi> A man of underſtanding is of a cool ſpirit, he doth not take fire immediately; that luſt ſhould riſe at one time and not at another, it can be attributed unto nothing but the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of God ordering and over-ruling and reſtraining it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">(3) The Lord doth let ſome luſts at this time ariſe, that it may ſhew a man that ſuch a ſin is in his nature, which formerly he haply never conſidered, never particularly repented of, and never ſaw the fruit of it breaking forth in his life. Now to lead a man to a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular acquaintance with ſin and ſelf, therefore the Lord doth let ſuch luſts riſe up in a mans heart. A man that haply never thought that he could be tempted to be an Atheiſt, and deny that there was a God, the Lord will let forth ſuch ſinful riſings and motions in his heart, that he ſhall be ready to call all into queſtion, and ſee that it is poſſible for the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of his nature to make him like that fool, <hi>that ſaith in his heart there is no God;</hi> and a man that never queſtioned whether the Scripture was the Word of God or no, (for it is the faith that he hath been brought up in, which he received from his parents) yet the Lord will let that luſt riſe in thee, which may bring thee to queſtion the authority of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, whether they be of God or no. There is in a man a principle that tends to a denial of the <hi>doctrine of godlineſs,</hi> and this principle lies deep, and works mightily in our lives; and therefore that they may ſee that this root of bitterneſs is in them, the Lord will ſuffer them to riſe up unto actual thoughts, and then the man will ſay, <hi>I thought I ſhould never have doubted whether there was a God or no, or a Heaven or Hell, or a Scripture, but now I ſee to what my natural corruption is ready to lead me,</hi> and by this means his ſoul is not only humbled
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:52030:240"/> for thoſe boſom-principles of Atheiſm, but theſe boſom-principles of Religion are laid anew and more firmly in the ſoul, which elſe would not have born the ſtreſs of a work of grace upon them.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4) That a man may be drawn out to hate ſin the more, therefore the Lord doth let it riſe in a man and infeſt him. As a mans darling luſt that has riſen in him moſt, and moſt troubled him, that ſin when he is converted he hates above all other, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.8. and ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. there is not only the being of ſin, but the riſing of it, <hi>Rebelling againſt the law of the mind, and leading me captive to the law of ſin and death, when I would do good evil is preſent with me;</hi> that the ſoul may ſee its miſery the more, and ſo hate its adverſary the more; for <hi>to love God and hate ſin is our great work,</hi> and the more the goodneſs of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is true, a man ſhould hate ſin in the root, hate it at all times, but ſpecially when it riſes within us, and preſents it ſelf to us with the greateſt enticement; as Chriſt hated Satan always, but then ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when he aſſaulted him with a temptation to worſhip him; ſo ſhould we deal with ſin, as <hi>Junius</hi> faith of himſelf, <hi>he being a modeſt man a wanton woman came to kiſs him, and he gave her a box on the face;</hi> he hated impudence at all times, but ſpecially when it was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; and ſo it is in this particular alſo, when luſt doth riſe in the ſoul preſenting it ſelf to be choſen, he hates it then moſt, as wicked men hate godlineſs always, but ſpecially when it comes neareſt unto them, and they are preſſed to it, then their hearts riſe againſt it.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5) The Lord doth in his Soveraignty permit that luſts ſhould ariſe in his people, but it is to awaken them; and the Lord makes this an excellent remedy againſt a ſecure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for if his people will ſleep, God has three ordinary ways to awaken them. [1] By letting out corruption. [2] By affliction. [3] By deſertion: it is the firſt of them is the worſt, becauſe there is not a greater evil than ſin, and there is not any thing that doth uſe to affect the hearts of godly men and awaken them more than to find former luſts reviv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A man has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſet himſelf to mortifie ſuch a luſt, and prayed againſt it, and uſed all means, and now he hath through mercy in a good meaſure attained it; but the man grows proud and ſecure, and carnally confident: then the Lord lets his luſt revive again, and the man ſhall ſee that his enemy is not dead, but that the ſaid root of bitterneſs ſtill remains; only the Lord by his Soveraignty permitted it to ſpring forth for ſuch an end.</p>
                  <p n="6">(6) It is that which is matter of repentance to the people of God continually; they are not humbled barely for the ſins of their lives that break forth in their converſation in the world, but alſo thoſe ſins that do ariſe in their hearts, and they do apply the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt for the one, as well as the other; and they are more humbled for luſt riſing in their heart (if they could be ſeparated) than for luſt breaking forth in the act, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this defiles the inward man, the ſoul; and ſo it's ſaid of <hi>Hezekiah, That he humbled himſelf for the pride of his heart;</hi> ſo confidence in creatures is what we ought to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for, and weep in ſecret for our pride, and repent of all the inward riſings of ſin in our heart, though not any diſcovery of it be made in our lives and converſation.</p>

                  <p>There are two ways by which the enemy hath always ſet himſelf againſt the people of God: (1) In a way of policy; <hi>For the children of this world are in their generation wiſer than the children of light.</hi> (2) <hi>In a way of power;</hi> they will be firſt as a Fox, and then as a Lyon, as the Pope ſaid, <hi>If</hi> Peters <hi>Keys will not do it, give me</hi> Pauls <hi>Sword:</hi> the ſame ſpirit there is in all wicked men, their aim is to deſtroy the Saints, but they are not willing to appear in it, if it may be hid. <hi>Neh.</hi> 4.11. the adverſaries ſaid, <hi>They ſhall not know nor ſee, till we come upon them in the middle of them, and ſlay them, and cauſe the work to ceaſe.</hi> They would fain accompliſh their ends, and effect their cruelty by a plot, that they ſhould never know who hurt them, that's their deſign. As the Devil, he will never appear as he is, if putting upon himſelf the form of an Angel of light will do it; ſo it is with the enemies unto the Church, <hi>Jeroboam</hi> robs the people of their Religion, but it was under a great ſhew of eaſe to them; and for their worſhip at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it was but a form, they ſhould have as good worſhip elſewhere, and as holy as there, and it was much more for their eaſe than to be in this manner ſcattered from their dwellings; and <hi>Julian</hi> raiſed againſt the Church the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt Perſecution, but it was under the ſhew of a toleration, let every man injoy the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of his own conſcience, he would have no man forced in his Religion, and he doth encourage the Jews to build their Temple again, and he doth himſelf favour the Gentiles in their worſhip, and yet he can bear with the Chriſtians alſo; ſo the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> in <hi>Auſtins</hi> time, (1) They did deny any to be a true Church but themſelves: (2) There ſhould be no compelling of men to live holy, <hi>coacta &amp; invita pietas:</hi> (3) That the Magiſtrate is not to puniſh or reſtrain Hereticks and falſe Teachers in matters of Religion, every man ſhould be leſt to his liberty.

                  <p>And here I would obſerve from the Scripture, (1) <hi>How wiſdom and carnal policy is looked upon by God, and what reſpect he hath unto it:</hi> (2) <hi>Yet how all this wiſdom, in the exerciſe and the putting forth of it in plots and devices, is by the providence of God turned unto the good of his people.</hi>

                     <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.15. (1) In the defect of wiſdom: <hi>That which is wanting cannot be numbred;</hi> there are many thouſand concluſions in nature that the moſt exquiſite underſtanding is not able to pierce into, and there are many thouſand turnings in providence that do amaze and <hi>non-plus</hi> the wiſdom of the wiſeſt men in the world; and therefore in this reſpect God doth even <hi>charge his Angels with folly,</hi> how much more men, that is, there is in them a <hi>negative ignorance,</hi> which is folly, if compared with the infinite wiſdom of the great God. (2) <hi>They cannot make a crooked thing ſtraight;</hi> that is, they do meet with men of croſs and perverſe ſpirits, which they cannot change, and men of crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſpoſitions, and they do meet in the way of their wiſdom alſo with many croſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, that all things do not ſucceed according to their plots, and as they would have them, and then they are put upon new plots and devices to rectifie the other, and yet when they have done all, their wiſdom could not prevent it, neither can their wiſdom reform it, that which is crooked will be crooked ſtill, and the men that oppoſe them will oppoſe them ſtill, and the ſtumbling-blocks that are in the wiſe mans way will be there ſtill, and all his wiſdom cannot remove them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

There are two things that muſt be exalted in the heart of the Saints in the Word of God: (1) The holineſs of the Word; (2) The wiſdom of the Word, a man muſt look upon it as that which will be his wiſdom alſo. Now a man that is profane, he is an enemy unto the word, and is not ſubject to it becauſe
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:52030:244"/> of the Holineſs of it, he muſt take more liberty than the Word will give him, it is too ſtrait and narrow a way for him; and a wiſe man is offended at the <hi>Simplicity</hi> of the Word, it doth not agree with his Wiſdom, he is ready to think he could give better Rules to guide a mans life, and bring him unto Happineſs, of governing of Eſtates, and ordering the affairs of men, than the Word doth lay down, and ſo he cannot ſubmit to it, becauſe he doth look upon it as a fooliſh thing, and as that which hath no wiſdom in it; but a man muſt ſubmit in point of wiſdom and holineſs to it.</p>

God doth ſet Divine wiſdom on work for them; for they have an intereſt in all the Attributes of God, and they ſhall be put forth for them as their neceſſities do require, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.120. <hi>It is time for thee, Lord, to work, for they have made void thy law.</hi> The Saints may deſire God to put out an Attribute then, and they do flye unto their ſtrong hold, unto their chambers, as <hi>Eſa.</hi> 26. as when the power of man is exalted againſt them, now it is time for them to ſay, <hi>We have no might againſt this multitude, but our eyes are upon thee,</hi> it is all one to thee to ſave with few or with many; ſo when carnal wiſdom is exalted, now is the time for God to put forth his wiſdom for them that are his people; for they ſay, <hi>We have no wiſdom againſt this wiſe and ſubtle generation, but our eyes are upon thee, and in thee is our wiſdom laid up. Herod</hi> had a plot againſt Chriſt, and he will come and worſhip him, that is, he would come and deſtroy him, and the Wiſe-men alſo that came to ſeek him; now is the wiſdom of God put forth for Chriſts preſervation, one is ſent into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the other are admoniſhed by God, and they return into their own country another way. And <hi>the people of God have more benefit by ſeeing the wiſdom of God acting for them, than they can have diſadvantage or diſcouragement, by ſeeing all the wiſe men of the world againſt them.</hi> O great is the ſweetneſs that the people of God have by ſeeing any Attribute act for them, and for their good, that by this means they may come to underſtand their inheritance in Attributes, which is far beyond that of creatures or promiſes: as a father, his bowels are moved for a child, when he ſees him in danger, and then his affections do diſcover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; ſo do the Saints expect that the Lord ſhall fulfil his relation in that reſpect, when dangers are preſſing upon them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

In the middle of all their plots they comfort themſelves in this, that they ſhall take no effect againſt them, till they have done the ſervice which the Lord hath, appointed them unto, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.32. they told Chriſt that <hi>Herod</hi> had a plot upon him to kill him, he ſaith, <hi>Go tell that Fox,</hi>

                     <hi>behold I caſt out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I ſhall be perfected.

(1) <hi>Noctu prorepit,</hi> he only goes forth in the night, doth all things ſecretly; and ſo do Plotters, they muſt not be ſeen, and a great part of their wiſdom is to be undiſcovered. (2) <hi>Nunquam rectis incedit itineribus, ſed ambagibus, He doth never go right on, but always he hath his windings and turnings;</hi> ſo Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians, they love to walk unſeen, and they never love to go in plain paths, but in ſecret ways to enſnare men: But Chriſt, when they told him of the deſign of this <hi>Fox Herod,</hi> he comforts himſelf with this, there is a ſet time for my work, and then when that is done my ſervice is perfect, then ſhall I dye, and I know all his policy ſhall be able to avail no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt me, till I have finiſhed the work that the Father has given me to do.

                  <p>Laſtly, They have experience of ſtrange, ſecret, and glorious deliverances by this means; and truly experience of God in any kind is no ſmall advantage to the Saints, they make much of their own experiences, and live upon them afterwards. <hi>Poſſidon</hi> tells us in the Life of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that as he was travelling there were certain of the Donatiſts, whom he calls <hi>Circumcelliones,</hi> that did lay wait for him armed to kill him, <hi>obvenit Dei providentia, ſed ductoris errore,</hi> but he miſſed the way, <hi>&amp; per hunc errorem manus impias evaſit,</hi> and ſo eſcaped. This drew forth in him and in many others of the people of God many praiſes unto God for ſo great and unknown deliverance: and I did the rather inſiſt upon this, becauſe the enemies of the people of God are very buſie in plotting againſt the Saints, and we have cauſe to fear the fraud of the enemy as well as their force; <hi>though if hand joyn with hand, yet the wicked ſhall not be unpuniſhed;</hi> and the God that has delivered, will again deliver. Theſe things may one day be worth thinking of; when we are caſt upon ſuch providences, that we know not what to do, then the Lord will ariſe for the help of thoſe that wait on him.</p>
